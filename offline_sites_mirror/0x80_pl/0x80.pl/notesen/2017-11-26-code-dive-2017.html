<img src="2017-11-26-code-dive-2017/DSC_0579_small.jpg" style="float:right; padding-left: 1em" /><p><a class="reference external" href="http://codedive.pl/">Code::dive 2017</a> was a free conference held in Wrocław,
Poland. The conference was organized and sponsored by Nokia Poland. The fourth
edition took two days (14-15 November), it was in a huge cinema near the city
center. There were five sessions, in each session one could choose from four
lectures. In total 40 talks in two days, awesome.</p>
<p>The organization was great, as always. The only downside was a pretty big queue
to the registration on the first day. Otherwise it was perfect; there were even
free snacks and water.</p>
<p>I attended following talks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Miodrag Molivić, &quot;FPGA for a software developer&quot;</li>
<li>Alex Crichton, &quot;Concurrency in Rust&quot;</li>
<li>Mark Isaacson, &quot;C++17 and beyond&quot;</li>
<li>Kamil Witecki, &quot;Architecture is (not) everything&quot;</li>
<li>Silke Holtmanns, &quot;Interconnection security -- SS7 and Diameter&quot;</li>
<li>Douglas Crockford, &quot;The better parts&quot;</li>
<li>Mateusz Pusz, &quot;Striving for ultimate low latency&quot;</li>
<li>William Kennedy, &quot;Go: Optimizing for correctness&quot;</li>
<li>Michał Sajdak, &quot;A story of 3 CCTV cameras - a story of 3 admins&quot;</li>
<li>Alex Crichton, &quot;Introduction to Rust&quot;</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="fpga-for-a-software-developer">
<h1>FPGA for a software developer</h1>
<p>It was one of my favourite talks. Miodrag presented an architecture of typical
FPGA, he also showed a number of open source tools that enables us to play with
FPGAs. He also got through core parts of Verilog, using as an example a simple
8-bit CPU. The CPU has a fully functional design -- it has got an ALU, a
control unit; it was able to decode variable-length opcodes and execute them.
At the end the speaker run a sample program on the CPU realized on a real,
cheap FPGA hardware. Wow!</p>
<p>Although I have already known some bits of FPGA and Verilog, the presentation
gave me a grasp of the whole stack needed to use the programmable arrays in
practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="concurrency-in-rust">
<h1>Concurrency in Rust</h1>
<p>Because I don't know Rust, I was keen on seeing the talk. I learnt that Rust
can precisely track the ownership and lifetime of values and thanks to that
many C++-specific problems (like read-after-free) are ridden off. To my
surprise Rust doesn't support threads. All multithreading work is done by
third-part libraries. Due to the ownership tracking, a multithread code is hard
to misuse.  Libraries won't allow to use shared values, which otherwise would
be the root of many problems.</p>
<p>The existing libraries are pretty rich; for instance, they support fork-join
pattern, as well as well-known primitives, like condition variables and
mutexes. The latter might make program unsafe, as wrongly used mutexes may lead
to deadlocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="c-17-and-beyond">
<h1>C++17 and beyond</h1>
<p>It was a review of new features introduced in C++17 and C++20. The speaker
described in details three upcoming changes from C++17.</p>
<p>The first one is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::string_view</span></tt>, a really nice <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::string</span></tt>-compatible
wrapper for any string data. The only disadvantage of this class is not
tracking lifetime of the underlying data, thus a string_view might be
dangerous when we forget about that trait.</p>
<p>The second feature is possibility of override <strong>a dot operator</strong>. Yes, it's not
a mistake. <strong>The dot operator.</strong> It allows to provide wrappers that are
transparent for programmer, i.e. no extra code is needed to properly use such
wrapper; it's spelled as a normal value. My first impression: it's a wolf in
sheep's clothing. I can't imagine how a programmer would easily reason about
the code.</p>
<p>The last feature is the nicest one: <strong>constexpr if</strong>. This makes possible to
get rid off all this utterly unreadable SFINAE crap and replace with explicit
conditions that are executed in compile-time. I'm grateful for this change.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="architecture-is-not-everything">
<h1>Architecture is (not) everything</h1>
<p>I didn't like this presentation. To be honest the whole talk could be squeezed
into a single statement: mind that you, a programmer, don't work in void, the
result of your work would be used by somebody.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interconnection-security-ss7-and-diameter">
<h1>Interconnection security -- SS7 and Diameter</h1>
<p>The best presentation I saw on all code::dives I attended. Silke described the
current state of the network which interconnects mobile networks; now there are
around 800 networks. The bad news is there's no security build in. Would you
like to fake a SMS? Not a big deal. Would you like to grab some private keys?
No problem, they're send in <strong>plain text</strong>. Would you like to locate a
cellphone? You're welcome! Approximately 1% of network traffic looks
suspiciously.</p>
<p>Moreover, entry points to the network, either hardware equipment or APIs, are
available on the black markets; not to mention that governments and special
forces has open access to that network. As Silke said, attacks on the
interconnection network are getting similar to attacks on traditional networks.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that we should be worried. The Internet is well known. All its
users, even non-technician, are less or more aware of the dangers come from the
net. The mobile network has even more users, and they (we!) are basically
unaware of technical details and perils.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-better-parts">
<h1>The better parts</h1>
<p>A nice show of the creator of JSON. He tried to convince people that Javascript
used properly is not as bad as it's commonly believed.</p>
<p>For me the most interesting part was presentation of a new format for decimal
floating point numbers -- more details on <a class="reference external" href="http://dec64.com/">dec64.com</a>. I
like it very much, the format nicely includes integers into the representation.
If broadly accepted, it would solve a great deal of problems that people
encounter in practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="striving-for-ultimate-low-latency">
<h1>Striving for ultimate low latency</h1>
<p>I enjoyed the talk! The speaker, who works in a trading company, showed several
ways and solutions to achieve low latency C++ code. For instance he showed how
factoring out a rarely called branch into a separate function speed up the code
(due to reducing use of the instruction cache size). The well known
<a class="reference external" href="http://godbolt.org/">godbolt.org</a> was used to show how complicated and time
consuming <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::shared_ptr</span></tt> is; and how cheap <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::unique_ptr</span></tt> is.</p>
<p>I really like Mateusz's call for measuring things. He said his predictions
about the performance are almost always wrong. Welcome to the club!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="go-optimizing-for-correctness">
<h1>Go: Optimizing for correctness</h1>
<p>I don't know Go very well, just read this and that about the language, even
though I enjoyed the talk. It was a really nice presentation of tools and
builtin facilities that allow to profile both the CPU and memory usage of a go
program. William made a live-coding session, where he showed how to use
different utilities to track down performance and heap problems. He also showed
that one can extend own application with hooks that can report the current
measurements, through REST API, I guess. I didn't get well that part.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-story-of-3-cctv-cameras-a-story-of-3-admins">
<h1>A story of 3 CCTV cameras - a story of 3 admins</h1>
<p>In the Polish comedy &quot;Va Bank&quot;, a seasoned robber opens a safe and his friend asks him:</p>
<p>--- Wow, how have you opened it?</p>
<p>--- You should have payed attention.</p>
<p>This presentation was like this. The speaker showed that he cracked three
different CCTV cameras. However, when it came to details, his answers was like
&quot;I know where to seek for because I'm experienced&quot; or &quot;can't give more
details&quot;. It was awful.</p>
<p>An important take away from this talk is that producers of pretty expansive
devices don't care too much about security.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction-to-rust">
<h1>Introduction to Rust</h1>
<p>The funny fact is that this talk was given in the last session on the last day.</p>
<p>I saw the previous Alex's presentation about concurrency in Rust; some
information was repeated here. From this presentation I learnt that although
Rust is advertised as a &quot;safe language&quot;, it has unsafe parts. <strong>Unsafe</strong> is the
language keyword, and such an unsafe block of code may be full of dragons.
In the real-world case of Firefox there is around 30% unsafe code (if I
remember the number correctly).</p>
<p>It was also said that thanks to Rust it was possible to build a concurrent CSS
parser for Firefox. According to Alex, C++ somehow prevented programmers from
this. However, I didn't get what these reasons were. I would love to learn
more details about the problems imposed by C++.</p>
