<p>If you read the Wikipedia entry about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAWG">DAWG</a>, then you find following
sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
Because the terminal nodes of a DAWG can be reached by multiple
paths, a DAWG is not suitable for storing auxiliary information
relating to each path, e.g. a word's frequency in the English
language. A trie would be more useful in such a case.</blockquote>
<p>This isn't true!</p>
<p>There is a quite simple algorithm, that allow to perform two-way minimal
perfect hashing (MPH), i.e. convert any path representing a word to a
unique number, or back &mdash; a number to a path (word). Values lie in the range
1 .. <em>n</em>, where <em>n</em> is the number of distinct words saved in a DAWG.</p>
<p>The algorithm is described in <em>Applications of Finite Automata Representing
Large Vocabularies</em>, by <strong>Claudio Lucchiesi</strong> and <strong>Tomasz Kowaltowski</strong>
(preprint is freely available somewhere online).</p>
<p>The main part of the algorithm is assigning to each node the number of
reachable words from a node; this can be easily done in one pass. Then
these numbers are used to perform perfect hashing. Hashing algorithm is
fast and simple, translation from pseudocode presented in the paper is
straightforward.</p>
<p>Algorithm requires additional memory for numbers in each node and a table
of size n to implement dictionary lookups.</p>
<p>I've updated <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/WojciechMula/pydawg">pyDAWG</a> to support MPH.</p>
