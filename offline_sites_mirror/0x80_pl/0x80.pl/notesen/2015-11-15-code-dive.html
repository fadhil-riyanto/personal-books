<p>Few days ago I attended <strong>code::dive 2015</strong>, an IT conference in Wrocław, Poland.
It was a one-day conference with a great number of presentations. There were four
stages and five sessions, in total 20 talks. Impressive number! But an attender
had to choose his own path of just five lectures. I think the decision was
pretty difficult. Sometimes less is better.</p>
<p>The conference was organized by <strong>Nokia Poland</strong> for the second time, and these
guys did the job very well. The location was perfect. The event was in a big
cinema near the city center. There were free food and water. You had only to
register online.</p>
<p>I decided to watch following presentations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Andrei Alexandrescu &quot;Writing Fast Code&quot; part 1.</li>
<li>Andrzej Krzemiński &quot;Constraint yourself&quot;.</li>
<li>Urlich Drepper &quot;Intelligent application configuration data management&quot;.</li>
<li>Bartosz Szurgot &quot;C++ vs. C: the embedded perspective&quot;.</li>
<li>Dan Saks &quot;Representing Memory-Mapped Devices as Object&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not going to describe here the presentations in details, because videos
should eventually appear on the official channel at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_l25lelCgcHtn3TeSyAQQA">Youtube</a>. I just point out
things which interested me.</p>
<div class="section" id="writing-fast-code">
<h1>Writing Fast Code</h1>
<p>Andrei performed a nice show, however some part were... hm, confusing. For
example he claimed that code <tt class="docutils literal">x = x/10</tt> emits a division instruction. This is not
true, all compilers run in so called &quot;release mode&quot; will emit multiplication by
a reciprocal of a constant. Check this for your own. Another big
misunderstanding of the speaker was the cause of slow writing operations on the
modern hardware. He claimed that after a write request a CPU loads a line of
cache, then modifies it contents according to the request, and finally CPU
writes the cache line back to the memory. No. It doesn't work like this,
simply. Slow down is caused mostly by multicore architecture and required
synchronization among cache subsystems. But this is not very important, I think
people should remember simple fact: fewer writes means faster programs.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2015-11-22</strong>: my friend Piotr reminded me another funny fact,
a speculation why division of floats is faster than division of integers.
Andrei claimed that the reason is... exponential format of floats. It's just
a subtraction of exponents, a division of mantissa and viola. I'm pretty
sure that it's not the real reason.</p>
<p>Andrei showed how he has optimized procedure converting a number to an ASCII
representation. He used few tricks, and one of them is worth to mention. He minimize
the number of &quot;real&quot; conversions by introducing a specialized path for smaller
values. Do the same in your program, analyze your data and use an <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> instruction
to select a fast path. It usually works. Andrei gained 3-5 speedup without big effort.</p>
<p>From perspective of a programmer who has never worked on code optimization
Andrei's advice were very valuable. For example: never measure time of debug compilation.
Compare your program with good, standard &amp; proved existing solutions. Your optimization
of one module could have a negative impact on the whole application. When you measure
a time, run tests many times and get the minimum measurement. Pretty obvious, but
precious for newbies (the conference was full of students from local universities).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="constrain-yourself">
<h1>Constrain yourself</h1>
<p>Andrzej's presentation was about building restricted data types, making no room
for misuse. The starting point of his talk was conclusion that standard C++
data types, like int or char, are a kind of void pointer, i.e. they are
transient, untyped entities. It's very true. Then he showed three examples from
the real life.</p>
<p>The first example was a type representing number of minutes since midnight.
Basically it was wrapped integer number having a tight API. Surprisingly amount
of code required to do this isn't very large. Constraints are checked in the
run-time during instance construction. And this is the only disadvantage,
because everything else is checked in compile-time.</p>
<p>The second example was a short string implementation, where length of a string
is given as a template parameter. First of all the class conserves memory and
avoid dynamic allocation, and also expose a very basic set of methods when
compared to std::string. However, thanks to the C++ type system, to distinguish
strings of the same length but different purposes, a programmer have to use
fake traits class. I really dislike this approach. It's ugly, but the only
solution.</p>
<p>The last example in Andrzej's talk was another class hiding from an user a
magic values designed to mean &quot;no value&quot; or &quot;no valid&quot;. The speaker compared
this solution with boost::optional. The boost template class can wrap virtually
all types, but at cost of additional memory. The magic-value approach has no
memory footprint, however it is limited mostly to numeric types.</p>
<p>The presentation has reminded me two sad facts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The C++ type system is weak, and making it stronger require some effort,
especially use templates (which make compilation time longer).</li>
<li>The class <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::string</span></tt> is the worst class ever, having giant API,
lacking useful methods, having no extension points (except allocator).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="intelligent-application-configuration-data-management">
<h1>Intelligent application configuration data management</h1>
<p>Urlich showed a little bit history of configuration files and all related
problems. There are three major issues: number of different configuration files
(like global in <tt class="docutils literal">/etc</tt>, user dot-files and so on), problem with versioning
(and changing values of a running application), and the last one: how to obtain
a current settings used by a program. Urlich mentioned also that some aspect of
program could be controlled through environment variables, however it is not
recommended by the speaker.</p>
<p>The first cure was to embed a Lua interpreter in our C++ program, as the
interpreter is very small and the language is pretty powerful. Lua scripts
gives more flexibility and are easy to extend on the fly. Indeed a nice
approach, but in my opinion this just move the problems outside a C++ program.</p>
<p>The problem with obtaining a current configuration was resolved really clever.
Urlich proposed to expose all parameters as a virtual file system, like <tt class="docutils literal">procfs</tt>.
He used well know FUSE &mdash; it works and it doesn't require too much code.
Thanks to file system an application can react instantly on parameter write,
and also versioning is possible. Moreover, an administrator can capture all
parameters using standard tools.</p>
<p>The talk was interesting. However the presented solution was strictly
Linux-related and IMHO was too complex for simple/average applications. Maybe
for large, complex applications dealing with significant number of parameters
this could be a good method.</p>
<p>I didn't like Urlich's slides, a wall of C++ code doesn't look good.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="c-vs-c-the-embedded-perspective">
<h1>C++ vs. C: the embedded perspective</h1>
<p>A little bit provoking title. But first of all I have to say that Bartosz was
speaking fast. Really fast. Really, really fast. He can be a host at auctions.</p>
<p>The speaker compared size of executables for different architectures (ARM,
Atmega and something else) produced by C and C++ compilers. For me it was a bit
surprising that C++ code was smaller in most cases. A C++ code used templates
in place of C macros, thanks to that a compiler was able to perform better
optimization. Simple CPUs have simple architecture and number of instructions
strictly determines an execution time. Thus smaller executable size means less
instructions and in fact faster program.</p>
<p>Of course a C++ program on an embedded system probably would never use RTTI nor
exceptions facilities, but at least a programmer could use classes and
templates, which helps a lot.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="representing-memory-mapped-devices-as-object">
<h1>Representing Memory-Mapped Devices as Object</h1>
<p>Another embedded-related presentation. Dan showed how to use classes to hide
hardware obscure details, in the case serial port settings. Dan started from a
C-like solution (really ugly and error-prone), and finished with a nice
encapsulation in a class. However, overloading <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> operator to
initialize hardware is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen (I've seen many
weird things, believe me).</p>
