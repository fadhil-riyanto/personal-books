<p>man locatedb says: <em>&quot;Databases can not be concatenated together, even if
the first (dummy) entry is trimmed from all but the first database. This
is because the offset-differential count in the first entry of the
second and following databases will be wrong&quot;.</em></p>
<p>It's true if we follow man authors &mdash; but concatenation is possible
without reencoding any database.</p>
<p>For details about the compression scheme algorithm please refer to
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_coding">Wikipedia</a>, the file format is described in
<tt class="docutils literal">man locatedb</tt>. In short: compression is based on common prefix
elimination in a sequence of strings &mdash; when a string share prefix
with the previous string, we store pair (length of prefix, rest of string).
For example if previous string is &quot;aaabbb&quot; and current is &quot;aaabcd&quot;, then
output is (4, &quot;cd&quot;), where 4 is length of common prefix: &quot;aaab&quot;. Locate
files also store differences between prefixes lengths; for example (4,
&quot;...&quot;), (5, &quot;...&quot;), (2, &quot;...&quot;) is encoded as (4, &quot;...&quot;), (5-4=1, &quot;...&quot;),
(2-5=-3, &quot;...&quot;) &mdash; this is the reason why we can't simply join database
files.</p>
<p>However joining locate files isn't very complicated and, as I previously
stated, do not require reencoding databases. We have to set diff value
for the first entry of an appended file to negative value of the length of common
prefix for the last entry of first file.</p>
<p>For example when the first file contains three entries (0, &quot;...&quot;), (10,
&quot;...&quot;), (-2, &quot;...&quot;), then last length is 0+10-2 = 8. The second file
contains (0, &quot;...&quot;), (5, &quot;...&quot;). After join: (0, &quot;...&quot;), (10, &quot;...&quot;),
(-2, &quot;...&quot;), (<strong>-8</strong>, &quot;...&quot;), (5, &quot;...&quot;).</p>
<p>Some time ago I wrote python <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/WojciechMula/locatedb">utility/library</a>, and now extended it to
perform this task. Implementation details:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>To obtain the length L of common prefix of the last entry, the first database is
decoded in a dry-mode (no results are saved).</li>
<li>Then the first file is simply copied to an output file.</li>
<li>Before copy the second database skip first dummy-entry (diff=0,
string=&quot;LOCATE02&quot;) and skip diff=0 of second entry &mdash; this need simple
file seek. Then save diff=-L, and finally copy rest of the second database
file.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've tested joined database with native Linux locate (under Cygwin) and
didn't notice any problems.</p>
