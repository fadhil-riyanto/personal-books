<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/WojciechMula/pyahocorasick">pyahocorasick</a> is a python module I started in 2011. That time I was
interested in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)#String_processing_algorithms">stringology</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho-Corasick algorithm">the Aho-Corasick algorithm</a> appeared to be
quite challenging. It was a sufficient reason to program it. However, I also
decided that the result shouldn't be another proof-of-concept, that nobody ---
except me &mdash; would use. Since I like Python, I chose form of a C extension,
which nicely combines a friendly Python API with an efficient C implementation.</p>
<p>Moving fast forward, the module gained a few users worldwide. Maybe this
is not the most popular package on <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/pyahocorasick/">pypi</a>, but people keep installing it.
Many users contributed to the code, documentation and infrastructure, or
reported bugs and helped with debugging. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pombredanne">Philippe Ombredanne</a> helped
a lot with different aspects of development &mdash; without him the project
wouldn't be so great.</p>
<p>This text is a result of recent work on stabilisation the module, that
was propelled by fixing <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/WojciechMula/pyahocorasick/issues/50">a long-standing bug</a>. The bug was driving me
crazy for more than a year. I want to show what means were used to
eliminate this and many other bugs. And also how the code quality was
improved as a side effect. I hope some of you find an inspiration
or solution.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-bug">
<h2>The bug</h2>
<p>Before we start I have to describe the bug, nobody should repeat my stupid
mistake.</p>
<p>The bug was caused by misuse of python function <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/arg.html">PyBuild_Value</a>, which is
used by a pickling mechanism. Basically, pickling used to be done as a simple
memory dump &mdash; the module created <strong>single memory area</strong> filled with some
binary data.</p>
<p>The invocation <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Py_BuildValue(&quot;y#&quot;,</span> ptr, size)</tt> constructs a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/bytes.html">bytes</a> object
with a copy of memory pointed by <tt class="docutils literal">ptr</tt>, having given size. The problem is
that such a format string gets size of type <tt class="docutils literal">int</tt>. I wrongly assumed that on
64-bit machines <tt class="docutils literal">int</tt> is a 64-bit number. It's not true, <tt class="docutils literal">int</tt> has only 32
bits.  Because of that, when size of the memory area was larger than 2GB,
strange things happen, as shown in the table below.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr><th class="head">64-bit size</th>
<th class="head">outcome</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>range 0 to <tt class="docutils literal">0x7fffffff</tt> (up to 2GB)</td>
<td>no errors</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>from <tt class="docutils literal">0x80000000</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">0xffffffff</tt></td>
<td><tt class="docutils literal">int</tt> is negative, empty buffer created but no <strong>error is reported</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>anything larger than 4GB, but bit 32th equals zero</td>
<td>created buffer of <tt class="docutils literal">size &amp; 0x7fffffff</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>anything larger than 4GB, but bit 32th one</td>
<td><tt class="docutils literal">int</tt> is negative, empty buffer created but no <strong>error is reported</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The solution was pretty simple: a huge memory area is split into several
smaller regions and the list of such regions is pickled. The size of single
region is limited to a few megabytes, it will never be close to the 2GB
boundary (although all data still can be larger than 2GB).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="problems">
<h1>Problems</h1>
<p>The module is written in ANSI C, thus obviously it suffers from common
problems known in this language; also some python-specific issues are
there. Here is a brief list:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>logic errors</em>: regular bugs, behaviours not matching
documentation (or common sense).</li>
<li><em>memory leaks</em>: there are two sources of leaks:<ul>
<li>lack of <tt class="docutils literal">free()</tt> calls;</li>
<li>leaks of Python object references. Each python object has a reference
counter, there's a leak when we forget about decreasing the RC,
causing the object to live forever.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>memory errors</em>: like double free, or decrease the reference of a not
owned Python object.</li>
<li><em>failures returned by API calls</em>: communication between a C extension
and python interpreter is done via the set of function; most of
these functions may fail and we have to handle erroneous conditions
properly.</li>
<li><em>string types and their representation</em>: Python 2 and Python 3 have
different string types: there are strings, bytes and Unicode strings;
a Unicode string can be represented in UCS-16 or UCS-32.</li>
<li><em>Windows builds</em>: Python extensions for Windows has to be compiled
with MSVC 2010. It can't be helped.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="cure-1-unit-tests">
<span id="cure1"></span><h2>Cure #1 &mdash; unit tests</h2>
<p>It might sound obvious, but unit tests are crucial when one develops a
programming library. In <strong>pyahocorasick</strong> unit tests have been existing from
the very start. They are written in Python using its standard library
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>; there are no C-level tests.</p>
<p>Firstly, unit tests have to cover basic functions &mdash; i.e. prevent from
logic errors.  For instance, <strong>pyahocorasick</strong> has functionality of a word
dictionary, thus unit tests check if adding a word really adds it or if
looking up a non-existing word fails, etc. Most tests are really simple, but
surprisingly detected a lot of mistakes.</p>
<p>Secondly, unit tests can check some very specific scenarios, also serve as a
regression tests repository. For example, I wrote a very detailed tests for
the unpickling code, where some binary data is manually constructed and then
handled by the module. This set of tests is useful during development, regular
users don't need to run them.</p>
<p>Unit tests are the <strong>base</strong> for any serious work and further refactoring.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cure-2-code-coverage">
<span id="cure2"></span><h2>Cure #2 &mdash; code coverage</h2>
<p>Getting code coverage for a Python extension is really simple. Just compile
the module with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-coverage</span></tt> option:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ export CFLAGS=&quot;-coverage&quot;
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
</pre>
<p>Then run unit tests, or other programs which use the module, and get a
coverage report using &mdash; for instance &mdash; <tt class="docutils literal">gcovr</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ gcovr --html-details -o DIRECTORY
</pre>
<p>The coverage report reveals which parts of C code are untested.  We
instantly see whether we're able to trigger that untested part via a
regular Python test or maybe a branch relies on the result of external
function call. Then, we might consider intercepting this function and
force returning certain value &mdash; this approach is described in
following sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cure-3-memory-leaks-detection">
<span id="cure3"></span><h2>Cure #3 &mdash; memory leaks detection</h2>
<p>A problem with a C extension for Python is that your C code is run within
the same process as the interpreter. The standard compilation of C Python
interpreter enables a custom allocator. That allocator makes the
<tt class="docutils literal">valgrind</tt> output unreadable, as valgrind reports tons of leaks or wrong
writes/reads, while in fact none of them are bugs.</p>
<p>It's possible to compile python interpreter with special
<a class="reference external" href="https://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Misc/README.valgrind">valgrind-friendly</a> flags. While compilation of a Python interpreter is not
a big deal, I decided to wrap <tt class="docutils literal">malloc</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">free</tt> and (recently)
<tt class="docutils literal">realloc</tt> procedures. A special compile-time definition enables memory
debug mode, thus in normal compilation there's no overhead.</p>
<p>There are two modes of debugging I implemented:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>dump all memory-related events to a file;</li>
<li>inject memory allocation faults &mdash; described in <a class="reference internal" href="#cure4">the next section</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The output of dump is a list of actions given in plain text, like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
A 1 0x7fafd9741148 40
A 2 0x7fafd9741120 40
R 1 (nil) 0x7fafd9d89728 8
A 3 0x7fafd97410f8 40
R 2 (nil) 0x7fafd9d89738 8
F 0x7fafd9da51a0
</pre>
<p>&quot;A 1 0x7fafd9741148 40&quot; is read as: allocation #1 of 40 bytes retuned
address 0x7fafd9741148; &quot;R 2 (nil) 0x7fafd9d89738 8&quot; is read as:
&quot;reallocation #1 of 8 bytes, old address was NULL, returned address
0x7fafd9d89738&quot;; finally &quot;F 0x7fafd9da51a0&quot; means &quot;free address
0x7fafd9da51a0&quot;.</p>
<p>A simple python script parses such file and points which allocations have no
corresponding free. Since each allocation/reallocation has unique id, we
might simply figure out where exactly in the code the leaked object was
created. I considered dumping also backtraces (there's nice <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Backtraces.html">backtrace</a>
function in GNU libc), but in practise it was way easier to run program in
gdb and obtain backtrace from debugger &mdash; I introduced an additional
environment variable that triggers <tt class="docutils literal">__builtin_trap()</tt> on allocation
failure.</p>
<p>Dumping allocation events helped several times in last two years, and
this solution proved to be really helpful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cure-4-injecting-memory-allocation-faults">
<span id="cure4"></span><h2>Cure #4 &mdash; injecting memory allocation faults</h2>
<p>For given allocation id we can force returning NULL in runtime; it's
done by setting an environment variable, thanks to that no recompilation
is needed when we want to check different scenarios.</p>
<p>It appeared that some users of pyahocorasick can allocate all memory
they have on their computers, thus failures of <tt class="docutils literal">malloc</tt> are likely. In
such case, the expected behaviour of C module is to properly report the
error to a python interpreter (usually by setting <tt class="docutils literal">MemoryError</tt>), not
to segfault.</p>
<p>Injecting memory faults appeared to be an amazing solution. I know the
word &quot;amazing&quot; is overused, but in this context is highly appropriate.
While the cost of introducing this was minimal, it revealed many latent
problems in the existing code and prevented other problems after
introducing the technique.</p>
<p>Before each release I get the number of allocations for all unit tests and
then check failure of each allocation. There are roughly 3000 allocation, so
it's not a big problem, just time consuming.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cure-5-injecting-python-api-faults">
<span id="cure5"></span><h2>Cure #5 &mdash; injecting Python API faults</h2>
<p>Since injecting of memory allocation faults was so successful, I decided
to do similar thing with Python API calls. Although the number of public
functions one can find in <tt class="docutils literal">/usr/include/python</tt> is huge, the module
itself uses a small portion of them. Right now there are only ~25 functions
used across the code.</p>
<p>All wrapped calls share the same call id and we can set, also via
environment variable, which call is expected to fail.</p>
<p>The wrappers are also enabled with a preprocessor definition. In a C code
a wrapped invocation looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code cpp literal-block">
<span class="n">py_value</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">F</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">PyTuple_GetItem</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre>
<p>Here the &quot;F&quot; is a preprocessor definition which either expands to the
original name of argument (<tt class="docutils literal">PyTuple_GetItem</tt>) or into its wrapped
counterpart (<tt class="docutils literal">PyTuple_GetItem_custom</tt>). The definitions of wrapped
functions are similar, and looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code cpp literal-block">
<span class="cp">#define PyTuple_GetItem_custom(...) (check_and_set_error() ? NULL : PyTuple_GetItem(__VA_ARGS__))</span>
</pre>
<p>The only C code is function <tt class="docutils literal">check_and_set_error</tt>, which is the same for all
wrapped functions. Depending on the type of API function, the failure result
can be the NULL pointer (like in case of <tt class="docutils literal">PyTuple_GetItem</tt>), or a negative
number or the zero &mdash; this distinction is done within <tt class="docutils literal">#define</tt>.</p>
<p>A side note: in most cases returning NULL is a sign of exception.  Python
expects that a C extension sets also an error using one of designated API
functions.  If NULL is returned but no error is set, the interpreter
unconditionally aborts execution! As you might guess, I found a few cases when
this problem appeared.</p>
<p>This solution also helped to solve many issues, fortunately not reported
yet by the users.  Not to mention that the code coverage went up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unresolvable-1-string-representation">
<h2>Unresolvable #1 &mdash; string representation</h2>
<p>The existence of Python 2 and Python 3 adds a lot of problems.  As I
mentioned earlier, internal string representations differs between major
python versions.</p>
<p>There are also problems with Python 3 string representation. Depending on
a minor version, platform, compilation setting and other factors I have no
idea about, strings can be saved in UCS-2 or UCS-4, and perhaps in UTF-8 ---
I got lost now.</p>
<p>All these issues mean that the module code has to deal with <strong>three
different data types</strong> and solve nuisances &mdash; whether a string is temporary
(and we need to keep its copy) or is a reference. Of course it's doable, but
costs dozens of defines, which lowers testability of code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unresolvable-2-windows-build">
<h2>Unresolvable #2 &mdash; Windows build</h2>
<p>The python official builds for Windows are done with MSVC 2010. This
compiler is maybe not an ancient one, but does not support the C11 standard.
In other words, declaring variables at any place in code is not possible ---
all variable declarations have to be placed before the first statement.</p>
<p>Well, it's not a real problem, it's rather... a constraint.
I just got used to it, but wish I didn't have to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="random-bits">
<h1>Random bits</h1>
<p>I described the most important methods, here's a list of things
that also help:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Automate what you can. I wrote several dead-simple shell and python
scripts that run certain procedures (like naive benchmarks, memory
consumption analysis etc.). State of most of them is &quot;works for me&quot; ---
they can be improved later, if needed. They save time of re-typing
the same commands over and over. And they really help if one has
short memory, as I do have.</li>
<li>If you can, include in error messages as much details as you have at
certain point of program. The bug I mentioned at the very beginning
was manifested with short message &quot;data truncated&quot;. It was silly, now
I see how silly. Later, I added to the message more date, like the
number of currently processed node (&quot;error during unpickling node
#1241094&quot;). When I saw a really huge node number in user's report,
something finally clicked.</li>
<li>When you deal with complex data structures write dumpers. Start with
dumpers! A dumper is a procedure that shows, in a human readable way,
details of data. Procedure can print something on console or save data
on disc which can be later visualized. Aho-Corasick automaton
is a graph structure, thus I coded dumper that produces <a class="reference external" href="https://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a>
input. Being able to see how graph nodes are connected (or disconnected...)
saved hours of debugging at early stages of developing.</li>
<li>Use CI servers. For open source projects there are free and easy to setup
solutions: <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://ci.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a>. <strong>pyahocorasick</strong> uses both, and is tested on
both Windows and Linux, it is build with Python 2 and Python 3, and unit
tests are run on all these builds.</li>
