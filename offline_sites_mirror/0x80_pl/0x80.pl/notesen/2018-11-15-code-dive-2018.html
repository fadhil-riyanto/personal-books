<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In November this year there was new edition of <a class="reference external" href="https://codedive.pl/">code::dive</a>, an IT conference
in Wrocław, Poland.  Practically nothing has changed from <a class="reference external" href="2017-11-26-code-dive-2017.html">the previous
edition</a>: it is still great.  The place is perfect, it's in a huge cinema
located in the city center. There were free snack and water, and amazing coffee
at decent price (the only downside was huge queues). As always, there were a
lot of interesting talks; a new thing were &quot;lighting talks&quot;, run during lunch
break.</p>
<p>This edition was a bit different, though. Although Nokia still sponsors the
conference, the organizers asked participants to buy tickets (25 złotych, 5
euro) and then gave all income to Polish Association of the Blind; I totally
love this approach.  BTW, approx 38,000 złotych were collected.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I'm Nokia employee right now, but am writing this text in my spare
time. The employer was so kind that I went to the conference during working
hours.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The talks I attended:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to Faster Builds&quot; (two parts) by <strong>Viktor Kirilov</strong></li>
<li>&quot;Clean code in Go&quot; by <strong>Mateusz Dymiński</strong></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-faster-builds">
<h1>The Hitchhiker's Guide to Faster Builds</h1>
<p>This talk, split into two parts, was packed with information. Viktor presented
an awful lot of different techniques and tools that might boost building C++
applications. On one hand it's good, but on the other hand I fell somehow
overloaded.</p>
<p>I didn't like the slides. They were filled with lots of text, and also
have links to other presentations or articles. It might be useful when one goes
through the presentation at home, at own pace. On a conference it doesn't look
well.</p>
<p>What I missed the most was real-life examples, hard numbers. There were some,
but still not much. Also statements like &quot;reportedly it's faster&quot; are not too
convincing.</p>
<p>I really liked the history of C++ modules. I'm always saying that development
of C++ is too slow and it's delayed several years to market needs. Modules are
a bright example. The first proposal appeared in 2004. Moving fast forward, now
we have 2018 and modules have just been accepted for the upcoming standard.
Only 14 years, and it's almost there! But the idea of modules is not new. For
instance, the first Ada edition from 1983 had modules (not to mention Modula by
Wirth); Ada 1995 introduced generic modules, that can be parametrized with
types. C++ programmers might be envious.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clean-code-in-go">
<h1>Clean code in Go</h1>
<p>Mateusz tried to defend a thesis that Go programs are by design clean. The
definition of &quot;clean code&quot; is that something is clean <em>if you see there what you
expected to see</em>.</p>
<p>The speaker cited all statements from the Go creators. So, we know that Go
syntax is simple, there are no exceptions nor classes. That Go is stable, there
are no new features and so on, and so forth. A Go source code is simple to
read, reason about, etc. I was a bit disappointed with this form, I rather
expected some real-world examples; I can always read Go propaganda on Hacker
News.</p>
<p>And to be honest, I didn't get convinced. But I liked the talk, as Matuesz also
mentioned not so bright features of Go. Like lack of generics which forces
people to copy-paste-driven development.</p>
<p>The funny fact is the Go creators thought the language would lure C++
programmers, as they solved some painful C++ problems.  It hasn't happened,
people switched from PHP, Python and other dynamically-typed languages, but not
from C++.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="goland-tips-tricks">
<h1>GoLand Tips &amp; Tricks</h1>
<p>My English teacher often says that I would do exercises from our textbook much
better if I read instructions. Add my glasses to this and you'll understand why
I was sure I was going to see &quot;GoLang Tips &amp; Tricks&quot;.</p>
<p>The single letter made the difference. It was the live demo of a commercial
product, an IDE for Go. During the presentation an extremely easy Go project
was edited and refactored.</p>
<p>But I'm not going to complain, to my surprise I enjoyed the show... in a way.</p>
<p>Let me start with a bit of personal history. Last time I used an IDE was 15
years ago. It was a pirated copy of Borland Pascal, run in DOS and I was
obviously younger. Later, when I moved to Linux, I realized that with multiple
shells &mdash; provided natively by the system or programs like <tt class="docutils literal">screen</tt> &mdash; an
IDE is overkill, if not a plainly stupid concept. The standard shell commands,
VIM and screen are enough to work rather efficiently.</p>
<p>So, while I was watching how these colorful boxes popping around, how magic
combinations of keystrokes have to be pressed in order to do basic text
editing, how many mouse clicks are needed to do this and that, I felt this
is not how I want to write my code. Ever. A simple script is better than
two clicks. This is my motto coined during writing this paragraph.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="taming-dynamic-memory-an-introduction-to-custom-allocators-in-c">
<h1>Taming dynamic memory - An introduction to custom allocators in C++</h1>
<p>I enjoyed the talk, one of the best I saw this year. Andreas showed how simple
allocation strategies work and also what traits do they have. He described
memory pools and another one which name slept my mind (it's the allocation
algorithm used by Pascal, where you allocate many objects but can free only
all objects at once).</p>
<p>We also learnt that C++ offers an interface to plug custom allocators, and that
the names of related namespace/function are as always counter-intuitive. The
C++ committee is bad at names.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-as-c-s-limiting-case">
<h1>Python as C++’s limiting case</h1>
<p>I'm not sure for 100%, but Brandon was the first presenter who wore a tie.</p>
<p>The whole lecture was funny. I love the slides &mdash; there were a few words on
each slide, typeset in a large font. One can read a slide in an eye blink, and
then concentrate on the speaker. Learn from Brandon.</p>
<p>It was talk about Python, how the language borrowed and simplified
concepts, mostly from C++. He made fun from JavaScript (<tt class="docutils literal">'4' - 3</tt> is
<tt class="docutils literal">int(3)</tt>, but <tt class="docutils literal">'4' + 3</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;43&quot;</tt>), saying that such an absurd are
almost nonexistent in Python.</p>
<p>One really funny thing that caught my attention was hesitation about
&quot;tuple&quot; pronunciation; English is funny.</p>
<p>BTW it was said that CPython has no garbage collection, but only referenced
counting. It's not true, there's a generational garbage collector, which can be
accessed via a standard module <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/gc.html">gc</a>. Simple reference counting doesn't deal
with cyclic references.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-do-practical-data-science-from-real-world-examples-to-recommendations">
<h1>How to do practical Data Science? From real-world examples to recommendations</h1>
<p>A nice description of three cases from Polish companies, huge ones: an
insurance company and telecom. Unfortunately, the talk was too technical, most
people are not data science practitioners. I expected something lighter and
easier to digest, sometimes it was a bit difficult to follow.</p>
<p>Most important takeaways from this talk are: 1) the big business is keen on
spending money if it can help (save more money, for instance), and 2) data
science doesn't require top-notch technology, most of work can be done on
consumer hardware; I think only the telecom case involved extra servers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="c-c-vs-security">
<h1>C/C++ vs Security!</h1>
<p>Do not confuse this talk with &quot;C/C++ vs Security&quot; (without the exclamation mark)!</p>
<p>It was a nice talk, which I didn't like. I feel like it was too chaotic, where
rather simple problems were mixed with very complex (like Spectre). Try to
explain Spectre in five minutes to a person who doesn't know modern CPUs'
details; it won't work, sorry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-trusted-trip-in-the-cloud-working-with-trusted-hardware-in-practice">
<h1>A trusted trip in the cloud &mdash; working with trusted hardware in practice</h1>
<p>My second favourite talk. It was a story about IT reality, about hurdles, about
specifications and implementations. I'm sure everybody listening to Gabriela
stories will find there part of their own history. Thus no spoilers, but
definitely loved XKCD used wisely!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="augmented-reality-the-state-of-play">
<h1>Augmented Reality - The State of Play</h1>
<p>A good overview of state of the art of augmented reality. The state is that
although different solutions appears on the market they are not successful. But
according to Rafał, this will finally happen and we should be already prepared.</p>
<p>One important takeaway is that we usually thing about augmented reality in
terms of vision, but humans have more senses. For instance, these noise-cutting
headphones are means of augment reality, which surprised me.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-algebraic-data-types-are-important">
<h1>Why algebraic data types are important</h1>
<p>Well, this talk reminded me following joke: &quot;any web service can be represent
by a nine-element tuple, but... it doesn't help&quot;.</p>
<p>Bartosz showed algebra of functions, which is the foundation of, I guess, all
functional languages. He claimed that C++ would be a better language if its
type system was designed bottom-down, from these fancy theory. The problem is
that all languages meant to replace C++ are either dead or used by few people.
Also functional languages haven't taken over the IT world.  My gut feeling is
that a type system is not a crucial problem.</p>
<p>The speaker had enormous number of slides, so he managed to show us just a
small portion of material. But I liked this, it was a bit like time travel to
the past when I was programming in SML, Ocaml and reading about Clean (the
language).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="random-bits">
<h1>Random bits</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The new word: <strong>shelfware</strong>. This is software which is put on
&quot;a shelf&quot;, i.e. it is not officially dead, but we're hoping everybody
will soon forget about it.</li>
<li>I overheard a phone call, which went like this: &quot;we learnt a lot of new
things, it appears that we have to remove everything and start over&quot;.</li>
</ul>
