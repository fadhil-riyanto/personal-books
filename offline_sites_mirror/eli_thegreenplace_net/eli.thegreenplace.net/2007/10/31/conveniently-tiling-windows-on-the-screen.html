      <p>
As I wrote <a href="../29/a-new-wide-screen-lcd-monitor/index.html">before</a>,
one of my purposes for buying a huge 22" wide-screen monitor was to use it as
two smaller screens for programming (I like to have at least two editor windows
open and visible at the same time). 
      </p><p>

Windows comes with some basic tiling capabilities. For example, right clicking
on the task bar and selecting "Tile Windows Vertically" will tile all currently
open (un-minimized) windows side by side. There's a more convenient way I wasn't
aware of until lately - you can select multiple windows by holding Ctrl and
clicking their task bar rectangles. When you have some windows selected this way
(and they will all be colored as "active" on the task bar) right
click on one of them and select "Tile Vertically" - it will tile
only the selected windows, in the order you've chosen them from
left to right.
      </p><p>

If you really want powerful tiling capabilities, you'll have to resort to
scripting. As I've <a href="../../08/08/windows-automation-with-autohotkey/index.html">mentioned</a>
once or twice, I'm using Autohotkey windows automation scripts for various
tasks. One of the things I like most about Autohotkey is
its active and creative user community. If you can think of
something that will make you life with Windows easier, just
check the <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/">forums</a> -
someone has probably done it before.
      </p><p>

So, it didn't take me long to find <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic21703.html&amp;sid=e8bbdb3ccfcd8fdd6e1a47617b9b43f0">WindowPad</a>
- a script that provides easy shortcuts for arranging open windows on the
screen. Now, having an open window in front of me, all it takes is pressing a
Win+Numpad combination (Win is the "Windows" button that is present on most
keyboards, somewhere in the area of the left Ctrl and Alt). Win+4 moves the
window to the left half of the screen, Win+5 to the right, Win+3 to the right
bottom quarter, and so on. Win+5 centers the window with as much width as I've
pre-configured, and Win+0 maximizes it. This script is wonderful and is really
making my life easier. Now you can arrange the windows on your screen in any way
you like, as easily as with a few key presses. And if you have more than one
monitor - it supports that too.
