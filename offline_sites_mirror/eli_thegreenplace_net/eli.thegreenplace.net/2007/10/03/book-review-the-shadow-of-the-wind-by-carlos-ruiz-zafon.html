The protagonist, Daniel Sempere is the son of a bookstore-keeper. At the
age of 10, he finds a rare book by one Julian Carax in the "Cemetery of
Forgotten Books". After finishing it, he finds out that there's someone
who is trying to destroy all existing copies of Carax's books. This is
how begins a complex plot that lasts about 10 years, and involves lots
of mysteries and original characters.
</p><p>

"Original" is a good summary of this book. On one hand a typical thriller, but
on the other hand not quite. There is something special about this book, about
the way it is written. It's not a deliberate page-turner like many modern
fiction novels aspire to be, although it could be, since it's obvious from the
start that the author has the skill to make it so. Instead, its plot unfolds in
a more relaxed tempo, spanning over a longer period of time.
</p><p>

There are many exciting characters in this book - like Fermin. This guy made me
laugh quite a lot, he's a hysterically funny guy. Inspector Fumero is also a
very unusual and interesting character, in his own wicked way. Another character
is probably the city of Barcelona, where all the plot takes place and that's
described beautifully.
</p><p>

I like books about books, so "The Shadow of the Wind" was a delight in this
aspect. Additionally, I felt there's a certain closed loop in it - the enigmatic
resemblance of Carax's and Sempere's lives. The difference is that Carax's life
turned extremely tragically, while Sempere's ended well. There's a strange kind
of emotionality hidden in this concept, and I found it very moving.
</p><p>

To conclude, this is a very good book. I can't say it's perfect - the author
seems a bit inexperienced and there are some omissions and inconsistencies.
However, in the whole, I loved reading it and hence recommend it.
