While this book was originally aimed at writers (of books and newspaper articles), solid writing skills are important for everyone. In these days of the content-rich web, people spend a lot of their collaboration time online. Blog entries, comments, forum and mailing list posts are quite a bit of writing, and one has to follow some simple but important rules to write correctly and effectively. 

What's best about it is the size. These days, when the feeling is that writers and publishers get paid by the weight of their huge tomes, it is refreshingly pleasant to hold a small pocket book of only 100 pages, packed with useful information. The guidelines for correct writing are presented as a list of rules, divided to a few subtopics, with a well-selected index making things easy to find. 

The book answers some of the most common doubts in writing English text: 

<ol>
	<li>Correct usage of punctuation: commas, colons, semicolons, dashes and periods.</li>
	<li>Possessive singulars of nouns ("Charles's book")</li>
	<li>Using the active voice, positive form and definite, concrete language for making a point effectively.</li>
	<li>Pairs of words that are commonly confused: among/between, inside of/inside, shall/will, that/which</li>
</ol>

On the downside, this book can be seen as overly pedantic. Some words it discourages to use are already ingrained in modern English, and the strict rules it contains aren't the best fit for all kinds of writing. Therefore, I would not advise using this book "religiously" as something obliging. Rather, it is best used as a useful reference for certain things. Some rules you might not agree with, but most of them are just plain common sense of English writing, and rules like the ones I listed above are decidedly essential.
