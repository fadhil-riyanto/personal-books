<p>
Steven Levy has written a masterpiece, and I will be forever grateful to him for
it. Although when I read it (circa year 2001) computers were much more
mainstream than the period this book covers (1960s-80s), the book still broke
new ground for me. It was before the blogging era, and especially before all the
aspiring hackers of the world "united" via a network of blogs, forums, feeds,
"planets" (feed collections on specific topics) and link accumulators like
Reddit and Digg. In other words, it was much more difficult for me to find
people with interests similar to mine. 
</p><p>

Or maybe I didn't look hard enough. This is not the point, anyway. The point is
that this book took me "out of the closet" as a hacker, proud of my hobby,
instead of wondering whether I'm some kind of an autistic freak. Reading it, I
understood two things of utmost importance:
</p><p>

<ol>
  <li>There were, and there are, many people with my interests and
    peculiarities. And these are the people that made the computer revolution
    happen.</li>
  <li>Somehow, Steven Levy managed to explain in words the reason people find
    computers and programming so fascinating. In some sense it was a revelation.
    I kept saying to myself "yes, exactly!" and "ahh, now I understand" very
    frequently while reading the book.</li>
</ol>

Here are a couple of great quotes from the book regarding (2):
</p><p>

<blockquote>What kept him going was his fascination with the machine, how it let
  you build complicated systems completely under your control. </blockquote>

</p><p>

I heard people referring to this as <em>instant gratification</em>. Engineering
is fun, solving problems is fun, and building solutions is fun - this probably
has strong roots in the ancestral humans, shaped by evolution to be smarter than
other animals. As opposed to other, more "physical" disciplines of engineering,
like electrical, mechanical or structural engineering, programming allows you to
actually create real and useful things with a computer as your only tool. An
electrical engineer may wait for a long time until his board will be produced,
and only then he can "play with it". For a computer programmer, things are much
simpler. It is very easy and quick to build systems and use them.
</p><p>

<blockquote>[...] computers were an infinitely flexible artistic medium, one in
  which you could express yourself by creating your own little
  universe.</blockquote>
</p><p>

"Code is art" is a very popular notion these days, perhaps coined by Knuth in
his "The Art of Computer Programming" books. People do art for fun - they draw,
play and compose music, write and design pretty gardens. In this sense,
programming is not much different - it is an act of creation and
self-expression. It is fun.
</p><p>

As I said, this book is a treasure chest of insightful quotes like the ones
above. Levy interviewed most of the who-and-whos in the world of computing from
the 1960s in the MIT labs and through the 1980s in the Californian game
development companies. In addition to being explanatory of the "hacker nature",
the book is also a great historical reference for the early years of computing.
How lucky we are these days to have the opportunity to hack so easily. Just a
few decades ago, people interested in computers had to use clanky, slow,
terminals or worse, batch-processing machines. There are so much free
open-source development tools one really doesn't need to spend money on anything
further than the hardware - and PCs are cheap and powerful.
</p><p>

I can't recommend this book enough to anyone interested in computing, and
programming in particular. As an aid to discovering your internal motivations,
you owe yourself to read it.
