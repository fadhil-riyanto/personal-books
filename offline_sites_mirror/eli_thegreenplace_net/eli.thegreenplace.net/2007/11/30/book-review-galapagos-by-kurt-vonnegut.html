<p>
I must say that I'm beginning to consider myself a real conservative in
everything related with literature. I can measure this statistically - I usually
like straightforward, historical books, and I usually dislike sci-fi and works
with too much imagination mixed in. I can't begin to count the amount of books I
thought I'd like and I hated (the best example is probably Neal Stephenson's
books, which, as a hacker, I was supposed to love, but which left me deeply
disappointed). 
</p><p>

Vonnegut's "Galapagos" is going to join this sad category. A priori, it was
something I was supposed to like - a book by a very famous writer (so he must be
good?) about a topic I find very interesting (human evolution and the Galapagos
islands). So it's sci-fi, so what, perhaps it could be "realistic" sci-fi of the
kind I like (Asimov, Tolkien) and not a mad-imagination kind of sci-fi of the
kind I don't (Stephenson, Vinge, Pratchett). But alas, it wasn't. 
</p><p>

"Galapagos" is a mad-imagination kind of sci-fi, the kind where the author gets
over-creative and leaves the books as a whole shallow, without any interesting
plot to follow. I repeat, this book <i>has no plot</i>. So what does it have ?
Is it humor ? Well, yes, of a kind. I suppose the writer tried to match Douglas
Adams here, but he failed. I only chuckled once or twice while reading it, and
noticed many places where the reader was probably supposed to laugh, but that
just weren't funny. Was the book supposed to be thoughtful, reflect some
criticism on humanity ? It sure tried to be. And it failed miserably. Peppering
every second page with the same "our big brains are the sources of our problems"
is hardly constructive criticism. So maybe I disliked the book because I hate
negative, pessimistic thinking. I hate people who don't propose solutions, don't
look forward, but only whine about all the problems. Even if they make jokes
from it.
</p><p>

This review, as I now see, appears a bit harsh. The book, after all, was quite
easy to read and finish quickly, because it flows well. But it left such a bad
taste in my mouth...
