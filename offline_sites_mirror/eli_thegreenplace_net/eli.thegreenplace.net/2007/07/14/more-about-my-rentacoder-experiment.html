      <p>
As I wrote <a href="../../04/21/doing-some-work-at-rentacoder/index.html">here</a>,
I decided to do some work via <a href="http://www.rentacoder.com/">RentACoder</a>
(RAC), mainly in order to do some interesting programming work and get back into
"the zone" after a period of burnout and procrastination.
      </p><p>

As of this moment, I have <a href="http://www.rentacoder.com/RentACoder/SoftwareCoders/showBioInfo.asp?lngAuthorId=1329573">10
  projects completed</a> with average rating 10 which puts me into the top 4%
percentile of RAC coders. This clearly shows, by the way, that of the 170,000
coders registered at RAC, only a few thousand are serious coders that do work -
all the others are people who've just registered and did nothing, or tried to do
some job and failed.
      </p><p>

The projects I did were very diverse:
      </p><p>

<ul>
	<li>Perl</li>
	<li>Common Lisp</li>
	<li>General algorithms (someone's Uni homework)</li>
	<li>Verilog</li>
	<li>VHDL</li>
	<li>Ruby</li>
</ul>
      </p><p>

The vast majority of the projects were someone's homework - RAC is quite popular
for that. Another thing RAC is very popular for is web programming, especially
in PHP. If I would really want to start making money on RAC, I'd beef up my PHP
and CSS knowledge, do a few test installs and customizations of Wordpress and
Drupal (both of which are very popular in requests for work) - with such
experience it's possible to earn nicely, I think.
      </p><p>

The most interesting project I did was not homework - it was a Ruby module for
diffing HTML files in a hierarchical manner. It was also the project with the
least $$/hour for me, because I considerably underbid it and then spent almost
20 hours for the $90 I got from it. It was fun, though.
      </p><p>

I also struck a "partnership" with a Pakistani guy, doing his "hardware design"
homework for him - I did 4 projects, writing code in Verilog and VHDL and
solving analytical questions about hardware design. This partnership dissolved
in the end because he was asking for extra work for no pay.
      </p><p>

About money, all in all I think I earned less than $10/hour for my RAC work -
which obviously isn't enough if you live in a developed country (especially
taking into account that RAC work is intermittent and isn't continuous
employment). However, for coders from developing and 3rd world countries, RAC
can provide a real source of income. I saw many offers that ask for a programmer
to work full-time, for sums up to $1,500 / month, with all the contracts and
payments passing through RAC. I think that for a programmer in a developing
country, this is extremely good pay - and you can actually make good money
working from home. So, if there is one grand conclusion from this experiment
it's that our profession (programming) is in high demand. If you're a good
programmer, fast learner and motivated, you can make money from RAC. Even for
people in developed countries, RAC can provide nice pocket money and even some
additional income for students. For instance, I earned $300 for doing a few
interesting projects - and had fun all the way because I like programming. And
now I have the $300 with which I can buy quite a few books online :-)
