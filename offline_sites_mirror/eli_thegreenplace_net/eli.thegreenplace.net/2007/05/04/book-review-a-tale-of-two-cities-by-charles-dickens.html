      <p>
This is the 3rd book by Dickens I read, after Great Expectations (which I didn't
like) and Oliver Twist (which I liked a lot). In some sense it's a typical 19th
century book. However, there are some notable differences.
      </p><p>

What makes this book unusual is that it has no central character. It has at
least 3 of them, or maybe even 5, depending on the point of view. It tells the
story of a family - father, daughter and her husband, who oscillate between
London and Paris in the turbulent years between the American independence war
and the French revolution. The latter, in particular, is presented in very
realistic and vivid colors. The author tries not only to describe some of the
events (all the characters being completely fictional, of course) but also
convey the motivation for them to the reader, mixing in some philosophy
occasionally. Here is a quote I liked:
      </p><p>

<blockquote>All the devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination
  could record itself, are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine.  And yet
  there is not in France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a
  leaf, a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under
  conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror.  Crush
  humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist
  itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of rapacious license
  and oppression over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according
  to its kind.</blockquote>
      </p><p>

In style, the book reminded me of "Les Miserables" for some reason I can't put
my finger on. Maybe the cynical stories of poverty, maybe the descriptions of
Paris, or even the subtle tricks played on the reader when some character does
something apparently without explanation, which becomes clear later. I also must
say that the first half of the book wasn't very good - it took Dickens a hell of
a long time to build up the plot and develop the characters. The second half was
much better, however.
