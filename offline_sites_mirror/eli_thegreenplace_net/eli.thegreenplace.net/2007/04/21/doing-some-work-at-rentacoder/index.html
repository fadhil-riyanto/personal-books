      <p>
I'm a firm believer in maintaining my programming and engineering skills sharp.
Unfortunately, even if the environment at day work is stimulating, sometimes
there are periods when you don't really do anything interesting from a technical
point of view. In other words, you don't learn anything new. So, to "keep in
shape" I need a constant influx of learning material. And there is no better way
to learn than to actually <i>do</i>.
      </p><p>

Once when I was young and full of motivation, I was inventing new problems for
myself to solve, and in solving them I gradually increased my programming skill.
These days, such motivations are more difficult to find. Luckily, I'm not the
only one with the desire to learn, so people have been making up all kinds of
problems to solve in a "group environment". Discussing the solutions with other
people motivates you to actually do the work. Some examples: <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/">Code Katas</a>, <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/">Ruby Quiz</a>, <a href="http://perl.plover.com/qotw/">Perl Quiz</a>, <a href="../../../../2004/05/21/acm-programming-problems-solving/index.html">solving
problems</a> from ACM's programming competition, and so on and on.
      </p><p>

However, being the ever practical engineer that I am, I find even these
approaches not especially motivating, mainly because they are synthetic. These
are not <i>real</i> problems people need solved, but rather artificial problems
made up solely for the purpose of exercise. Not that this is a bad thing, but I
just find it hard to get motivated by these things for a long period of time. So
how do you find real problems to exercise on ?
      </p><p>

Enter <a href="http://www.rentacoder.com/RentACoder/default.asp">RentACoder</a>.
Shortly, it is a marketplace of programmers. "Buyers" arrive with problems they
need solved, "sellers" are programmers who have the skills to do the work. This
is outsourcing taking to the extreme. A localized example of laissez faire
capitalism.
      </p><p>

How popular is this thing ? Very. At the moment there are 74,000 registered
buyers and 175,000 registered sellers on the site. There are almost 2,500 open
bid requests (jobs need to be done) and new ones are popping at a rate of a
hundred a day. Buyers range from students needing solutions to homework, to
companies hiring serious programmers for prolonged periods on contracts worth
thousands of dollars. Sellers range from programmers yearning for some
experience and skill sharpening to complete outsourcing firms in Russia or India
that make their living through the website. After a job is completed, the buyer
rates the seller and vice versa, thus creating a full ranking and reputation
system that makes the consistent, fair buyers and skilled, serious sellers stand
out.
      </p><p>

I registered last week and have already completed two small projects.
Unfortunately, both seem to be homework (one text processing in Perl, another a
simple parser in Lisp), but you must start with something to get rated and have
at least some portfolio. I made very low bids on purpose to win the requests -
you can be either very good or dirt cheap, and since I'm still not rated there's
no other way but price to assess my bid. In total I made a whopping $18 from the
two projects - ice cream money. Do I feel bad for the poor Pakistani whom I
outbidded, and that could pay a week's rent from these $18 ? No. The buyer
wanted a job done. I proposed the lowest sum. Not very different from the US dad
who was fired from his data entry job that can be done at 1/10th the price by
this same Pakistani's uncle. This is capitalism, deal with it.
      </p><p>

I surely don't plan to make any serious money from RentACoder. At best, I will
earn enough in a few months to buy a couple of books on Amazon. But I do feel
that RentACoder gives me far stronger motivation to actually do the work than
any artificial "Quiz". It is fun to solve a real problem, to be on schedule, to
have some money and reputation on the line. Somewhat like gambling - you don't
do it for the money, you do it for fun. But what makes it fun is the money.
      </p><p>

What I do expect is for RentACoder to be a skill sharpener. Once I gain some
reputation and good ratings by completing small and cheap assignments, I will
have a far better chance to win the really interesting bid requests, ones that
involve learning new things.
