    <p>
        In time I became very frustrated with my <a href="../../../07/27/educational-path/index.html">educational
        path</a> for industrial strength Common Lisp. Things should not be as
    hard as this to install a few libraries that are probably in very common use
    (relatively). Maybe I'm dense, maybe I'm impatient, or maybe I'm just using
    the wrong implementation (CLISP on Windows), but I found this experience
    very painful.
    </p><p>

Common Lisp has a comprehensive standard, true. But a standard is not enough.
You also want a free implementation that conforms to the standard. Most modern
programming languages like Perl and Ruby have one "base" implementation which
everyone uses. Is there really a need for more ? I don't think so (think about
Java, C/C++ (gcc), C#, Python, it's the same story...). The base Perl
implementation is quite enough to serve millions of happy Perlists writing
useful applications. Sure, Ruby now has forking implementations for the JVM and
CLR, but they all try to fully port the base implementation in its entirety, and
not just the core language. 
    </p><p>

Having a "full standard" to which many implementations conform is nice, but do
everyday programmers <em>really </em> need it ? I'm not sure at all. Take Common
Lisp for instance. That it has many popular implementations makes things worse,
in my very humble opinion. Take a typical newbie post to comp.lang.lisp -
they're all very much alike. Newbies are always asking which implementation to
use - which is better, what are the differences, etc. Although it isn't easy for
old-timers to relate, a multitude of implementations is confusing. Especially
when you pick not the most popular and supported one (which seems to be CmuCL /
SBCL on Linux for Common Lisp) - you're up for a lot of uphill struggle.
    </p><p>

I have a theory that what drives programming languages into the spotlight is the
mass of newbies, not the few elite hackers who can recite selected parts of the
implementation's source code in their sleep. A language can be average, but once
it has a lot of support, it breaks into public awareness and gradually improves
to become pretty good. 
    </p><p>

Take the small and modest <a href="http://newlisp.org/">Newlisp</a>, for
example. It is a dialect of Lisp which is, admittedly, quite inferior to CL and
Scheme. However, it has a single well-supported implementation, a lot of useful
libraries right out of the box and a vibrant and supportive user community which
makes it much more fun for newbies than Common Lisp. Sure, CL hackers walk with
their nose pulled high in pride of how CL is vastly superior to Newlisp as a
language for "serious programs". But most of these newbies will take a couple of
years to reach the level of those "serious programs" anyway, and some may never
reach it. And in the meantime, they will use Newlisp, have fun and brag about it
to their friends, while CL hackers will look with envy. Another recent example
is the <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a> language I wrote
about <a href="../../08/windows-automation-with-autohotkey/index.html">earlier</a>.
As I said in that post, the programming language driving AHK can make any
programming purist nauseous. It is <i>that</i> bad, true. However, it is usable,
and the language installs easily, has tons of libraries and users who submit a
lot of useful scripts and libraries. In the meantime, its responsive author is
slowly but surely improving the language. All you need is the initial push, the
dynamic resistance is much lower than the static resistance, as we all know from
physics.
    </p><p>

This is not to say that languages should be weak and all that matters is the
implementation, not at all. It <b>is</b> to say that Common Lisp is damn
unattractive for new programmers. Probably the least attractive of the popular
languages. To make it more attractive, some changes need to be done, especially
making it more newbie-friendly. I think that the litmus test for newbie
friendliness is something like this:
    </p><p>

<ol>
	<li>You can easily download and install a free implementation of the language, preferably for Windows, where the vast majority of computer users is (and hence the newbies and the clients).</li>
	<li>With a simple copy-paste of code, you can pop-up some rudimentary GUI, right out of the box.</li>
	<li>If you want a library that does *whatever*, you can easily download it from some central repository and install it, without the need to compile anything with your own compiler.</li>
	<li>Have any question answered in a well-written documentation and set of Wikis, FAQs and forums with helpful users.</li>
</ol>
    </p><p>

At the moment, Common Lisp fails to pass this test. I think that while this is
the situation, CL will fail to become more popular and will stay a curiosity.
Some CL users say it's for their own good, but I doubt that. Even inferior
languages like Newlisp pass this test, not to mention Ruby, Python and even
Scheme (for example PLT Scheme).
    </p><p>

The most successful products in this world are not necessarily the best ones. It
is the best marketed ones. I think this is one of those cases.
