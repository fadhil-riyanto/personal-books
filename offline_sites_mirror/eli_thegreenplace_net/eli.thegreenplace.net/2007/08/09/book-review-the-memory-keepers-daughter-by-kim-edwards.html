Kim Edwards is an unfamiliar author who made a blazing debut with this book,
right into the NY Times #1 bestseller spot. <em>The memory keeper's
daughter</em> is a novel about the life of an American family in the
1960s-1980s, following the consequences of a dramatic decision made by David
Henry - when his wife gave birth to twins, a healthy boy and a girl with Down's
syndrome, David decided to give the girl away to an institution, telling his
wife that she died at birth. However, the girl didn't reach an institution, but
was rather raised by a nurse from the hospital who just couldn't leave her.
      </p><p>

It is a very emotional story, full of sentimental moments, following the life of
David, his wife Norah and their son Paul, and in another place the nurse
Caroline and the child with the Dawn's syndrome, Phoebe. What I liked most about
the book is how realistic it is. It's not one of those Harlan Coben / Dan Brown
thrillers that present new surprises on each page. Neither is it a soap opera.
It simply is a story of a group of connected people quietly living their lives
in the shadow of one critical decision made in a split of a second. In some way
it is about what happiness really is, which makes you thoughtful while reading.
      </p><p>

I don't usually like fiction, but this one is really recommended.
