                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;WebAssembly: The Definitive Guide&quot; by Brian Sletten - a wide and shallow
overview of the WASM landscape. Logically, it can be seen as a compantion to
&quot;The Art of WebAssembly&quot; which goes deep into the WASM language and spec;
in reality, it falls short. The book is full of laborious explanations
of computer basics, teaches basic C, basic Rust, etc. It's not clear if the
book is meant for actual programmers or for non-technical folks getting
the lay of the land. There's no depth in the code samples either - it's just
a collection of &quot;Hello World&quot;-level snippets gathered from the introduction
pages of documentation. It pains me to write such a negative review of a
technical book - clearly there was a lot of effort put into this one; that
said, it's just not worth the time, IMHO.</li>
<li>&quot;Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb&quot; by Richard Rhodes - a detailed
history of the emergence of H bombs in both the USA and USSR, though it could
equally accurately be called &quot;The story of Soviet espionage in the US nuclear
program&quot; or &quot;How the Soviets developed their nuclear weapons&quot;. In fact, these
two subjects probably get much more coverage in the book than its title
subject. The book is good, but more details on the actual physics and
engineering of H bombs would make it great.</li>
<li>&quot;What Do You Care What Other People Think?&quot; by Richard Feynman - additional
stories from Feynman's life; this is a sequel to &quot;Surely you're joking&quot;.
While some of the stories in this book are fun and new, some others overlap
with the previous book quite a bit. The part on the Challenger disaster
investigation is very long and takes up a good chunk of the book. Overall I
enjoyed the book, though it's clearly approaching the threshold of diminishing
returns for sequels.</li>
<li>&quot;Inventor&quot; by Gersh Taicher - (read in Russian) the next installment of this
autobiographic tale, focusing on the late 1980s and early 90s, when the author
created a company for well logging using nuclear magnetic resonance and tried
other inventions with similar approaches. I liked this book a bit more than
the previous one; it discusses the creative process in an insightful way.</li>
<li>&quot;Things to make and do in the 4th dimension&quot; by Matt Parker - a tour of
various mathematical topics the author finds interesting, written in an
accessible and conversational way. While the book's title mentions 4D and
the author tries to dedicate some chapters to this topic, it's not a big part
of the book and I didn't find those parts super insightful (4D is just hard!),
though overall the book is not bad. Not amazing, but not bad either.</li>
<li>&quot;Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years&quot; by Diarmaid MacCulloch - a
very long history of Christianity from its inception and until the early 21st
century. Overall, I found this book tedious and unsatisfactory. The first
third or so - dealing with very early Christianity and its origins - is pretty
bad, IMHO. Its organization is a mess, bouncing from topic to topic, with very
little evidence provided for anything. It may be the case that indeed early
Christianity just isn't very well documented; unfortunately, this was the
part I was most interested in. The rest of the book is somewhat better and
more readable (probably because it has actual written sources to rely on), but
still not great. I'm relieved to be done with it.</li>
<li>&quot;Failure Is Not an Option: Mission Control From Mercury to Apollo 13
and Beyond&quot; by Gene Kranz - autobiographic book by the NASA flight director
who ran many of the famous lunar missions, including Apollo 11 and 13. Very
detailed, in-depth account of how mission control works and the various
problems they grapple with. When space missions are celebrated it's usually
the astronauts and engineers in the limelight, but mission control plays
a critical role too - and this book is good at explaining why.</li>
<li>&quot;A Thousand Trails Home&quot; by Seth Kantner - an auto-biographic story of the
author's growing up in the family of subsistence hunters in the remote
north-west of Alaska, mixed with tidbits about Alaskan history, the changes
undergoing the state's landscape, animals and population, as well as a few
Caribou recipes. Excellent book, highly recommended.</li>
<li>&quot;The Infinite Staircase&quot; by Geoffrey A. Moore - a grand theory of everything
with the author trying to create a coherent philosophy of living rooted in
modern secular values. Valiant attempt, but IMHO completely misses the mark. I
found this book to be very tedious and don't recommend it.</li>
<li>&quot;Fire in the Valley: The Birth and Death of the Personal Computer&quot; by Michael
Swaine, Paul Freiberger - this book is alright, but it would be much better
if it focused on the technical details rather than MBA stuff.</li>
<li>&quot;On Call in the Arctic&quot; by Thomas J. Sims - an autobiographical account of
a doctor's 16-month assignment in Nome, Alaska in the early 1970s. Very
interesting and well-told stories of local life, though it does feel like the
author has a tendency for tall talking. Also, if you're easily grossed out
by medical details, this book is probably not for you.</li>
<li>&quot;how to: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems&quot; by Randall
Munroe - somewhat similar idea to &quot;What if&quot;, but from a slightly different
direction. Munroe gets to pick the subject and examine it from multiple
angles. Another fun book!</li>
<li>&quot;The Dark Forest&quot; by Cixin Liu - part 2 of the &quot;Three body problem&quot; trilogy.
I liked this part even more than the first one.</li>
</ul>
