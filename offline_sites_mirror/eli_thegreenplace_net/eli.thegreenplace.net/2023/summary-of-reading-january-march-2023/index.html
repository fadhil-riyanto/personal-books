                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;The Nine: Inside the secret world of the Supreme Court&quot; by Jeffrey Toobin - a
detailed survey of the Supreme Court's justices, their selection process and
key cases from the mid 1980s and until ~2007 or so. Very interesting look
inside the works of the court that helps one understand how it operates.
Unfortunately, the book is author to remain politically neutral, although he
seems to be trying to. IMHO this book could be much more powerful and
impressive if it didn't have a political agenda in the background.</li>
<li>&quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; by Cixin Liu - a pretty good work of science fiction,
very original. It's refreshing to read a book where the plot doesn't circle
around the US, the protagonists aren't American or European and not everyone
speaks English. I also felt like the book teaches a bit of history about China
in the 1960s-1980s, and has additional - more global - political overtones
talking about extreme environmentalism leading to self-loathing and striving
for destroying humanity. The science fiction aspect of the book is
wide-ranging, from Martian-style hard science fiction, to completely
fantastical dreams. The mixing up of technological levels is a bit jarring - a
society that can unfurl fundamental particles into different dimensions and
communicate across the universe using quantum entanglement surely will have
better computing paradigms than etching VLSI circuits with PN junctions onto
2D surfaces, right? That aside, I did enjoy the book quite a bit and will read
the next part.</li>
<li>&quot;The Way Things Work Now&quot; by David Macaulay - a large, illustrated book that
explains how much of modern technology works, with detailed hand-drawn
diagrams and a bunch humor using silly mammoths. While the diagrams are really
great, the book is often quite shallow. It does serve its main goal - to keep
kids engated while learning about technology.</li>
<li>&quot;Birds, Beasts and Relatives&quot; by Gerald Durrell - book 2 of the Corfu trilogy,
detailing some additional adventures the author had with his family.
Interestingly, many of the stories here (both human and animal) are...
reproduction-oriented, I guess? Not sure if it's accidental or aims to
represent the protagonist's age and thought process in some way. One of the
funniest books I've read in a long while.</li>
<li>&quot;What If? 2&quot; by Randall Munroe - additional questions answered; these are a
bit more esoteric on average, but still fun to read with a good mix of hard
science and humor.</li>
<li>&quot;Good Prose: The Art of Nonfiction&quot; by Tracy Kidder and Richart Todd - in this
book the Pulitzer-winning author Kidder and his long-time editor share their
thoughts and experience in writing and editing nonfiction articles and books.
It's a nice read if you want to learn how writing happens in real life; if
you're looking for tips on writing nonfiction, this book won't be of much use
IMHO.</li>
<li>&quot;Handprints on Hubble&quot; by Kathryn D. Sullivan - one of the space shuttle
astronauts tells about her career, focusing on her role in the development
and launch of the Hubble space telescope. Very comprehensive book with lots of
interesting details, particularly w.r.t. serviceability in space and how they
planned and trained for it.</li>
<li>&quot;Bond Investing for Dummies, 3rd edition&quot; by Russell Wild - a very detailed
and thorough book, and I found the advice given in it sound overall; the
author's general investing philisophy seems well aligned with mine (not just
on bonds). It's up-to-date (published in mid-2022), but the author didn't
spend much time talking about the bond market in 2022 - which turned out to be
unusual. I can sort of understand the ommission - the book wants to stay
relevant for years to come - but this is my only criticism. Otherwise, very
solid.</li>
<li>&quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; by Stephen Hawking - I'm quite sure I've read this
one before, but it was more than 20 years ago so there's no record. Hawking
is a prominent theoretical physicist that described the process by which black
holes emit radiation (now called Hawking radiation); he wrote this book &quot;for
people without physics background&quot;, trying to explain modern physics from its
beginnings and all the way to advanced origin-of-the-universe topics. The book
is well written and interesting, but many parts of it are still extremely
dense and require a physics degree to decipher. The book also shows its age,
as several important discoveries were made after 1988 (for example - the
detection of gravitational waves).</li>
<li>&quot;Atoms in the Family&quot; by Laura Fermi - a biography of Enrico Fermi, written
by his wife. Starts with Fermi's childhood, through his career in Italy and
the move to the USA with stops in NY, Chicago and Los Alamos. The writing is
straight-to-the-point and unadorned, which is a refreshing change from typical
professional biographers. Pretty good book overall.</li>
<li>&quot;The Art of WebAssembly&quot; by Rick Battagline - a nice introduction to
programming in WASM. This book focuses on the WASM language itself (the
textual format), discussing many aspects of its usage and interaction with
the JS host environment (in the browser or Node.js); there are numerous code
samples to try and experiment with.</li>
<li>&quot;Where the Crawdads Sing&quot; by Delia Owens - a lightweight mystery novel
about a woman who grew up alone in the marshes of the North Carolina
coast, having been abandoned by her family from a very young age. The mystery
plot is a bit weak, but the descriptions of the flora and fauna of the region
make for a pleasant reading overall.</li>
<li>&quot;Emigrant&quot; by Gersh Taicher - (read in Russian) a family member recommended
this book - an autobiographic account of an emigrant from the USSR to Israel
in the 1970s. The book is entertaining, humorous, and likely interesting
for people with the right background. I did find the writing to be somewhat
too self-centric, however. Granted, this is an autobiography, but I've read
many of those and something's a bit off here. Perhaps everyone is
self-centered, and the author is just being more honest than average? Another
observation is how rooted the author's world-view is in his USSR past; it's
quite remarkable, really, given that he left there at 26 and wrote this book
in his late 60s. This is very interesting to ponder w.r.t. when our brains
mature and get &quot;set&quot; for life.</li>
<li>&quot;How we got to the Moon&quot; by John Rocco - one of those rare gems you find while
randomly browsing the science section of a public library with your kids. In
this book the author presents a detailed description of the Apollo 11 mission,
focusing on all the science, engineering and training that went into it. The
information is distilled enough to be understood by middle-schoolers, but
isn't dumbed down. The author presents &quot;problems&quot; and &quot;solutions&quot; and covers
pretty much every aspect of the mission, with details as minute as the design
of the flame deflector for the launch or how thermal insulation between fuel
tanks works. What's most amazing about this book is the colored illustrations
on every page, drawn by the author himself. The illustrations cover everything
from engineering details to the people involved in the mission. Extremely
impressive work.</li>
<li>&quot;The Covenant&quot; by James Michener - historical epic novel about South Africa.
Paints a fairly damning picture of the Afrikaans population leading to
apartheid, and in particular the role fanatical religious zeal played in it.
Interestingly, this book was written in 1980, right before the critical decade
that saw the dissolution of that regime. Like in some of Michener's other
books, he tries to give equal treatment to different eras in terms of book
pages; while this is a noble goal, it doesn't always make sense. Much more is
known about the 20th century than about ancient Xhosa, for example, so the
Xhosa stories end up being long-drawn soap operas while precious little page
budget is dedicated to pivotal historial moments in the last 200 years and
some parts read like a condensed encyclopedia entry.</li>
<li>&quot;Meltdown: Earthquake, Tsunami, and Nuclear Disaster in Fukushima&quot; by
Deirdre Langeland - a short but detailed and interesting book about the
Fukushima disaster.</li>
