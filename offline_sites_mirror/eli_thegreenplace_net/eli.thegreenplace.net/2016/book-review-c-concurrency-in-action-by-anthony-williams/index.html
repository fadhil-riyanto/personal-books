                <p>Anthony Williams is a member of the C++ standards committee, and the author of
<em>Just Threads</em>, one of the earliest implementations of a standards-conforming
C++11 threading library. This book is an overview of concurrent and parallel
programming with the new C++11 threading features. It's both a tutorial and a
reference, with a large chunk dedicated to a detailed encyclopedic listing of
all the C++11 threading-related objects and their methods (I'm not sure how
useful this is in 2016 when all these references are already online, but could
certainly be more relevant in early 2012 when the book was initially published).</p>
<p>The book is very comprehensive. It not only goes over the C++11 threading and
concurrency features (of which there's a very good and thorough coverage), but
also discusses general parallelism topics like concurrent data structures,
including lock-free variants, thread pools and work-stealing. As such, it's not
light reading and is definitely a book you go back to after finishing it to
re-read some of the more complex topics.</p>
<p>On the critical side, the book's age already shows. I imagine the author didn't
have access to fully conformant compilers when he was initially writing it, so
many C++11 features are not used when they should be: things like range loops,
reasonable uses of <tt class="docutils literal">auto</tt>, even placing the ending <tt class="docutils literal">&gt;&gt;</tt> of nested templates
together without whitespace in between. Instead, there are occasional uses of
Boost. All of this is forgivable given the book's publish date, but a bit
unfortunate in a book specifically dealing with the C++11 standard.</p>
<p>Other random bits of criticism:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The analogies the author uses are weird, and often unhelpful. The book is
clearly aimed at seasoned programmers, so we should drop the dumbing down.</li>
<li>Diagrams are sometimes ugly and sometimes nice.</li>
<li>The explanation of memory ordering semantics wasn't amazing, IMHO. I realize
it's a devilishly complex topic to explain, but feel it's important to mention
in case someone wants to get this book solely to understand memory ordering.</li>
<li>The code samples living in a <tt class="docutils literal">.zip</tt> file that you can download are sometimes
slighly different from the listings in the book, and I found several occasions
where they don't compile. Unfortunately, emails sent to the author about these
were not answered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I liked the book. It's not perfect, but it's the best we've currently
got to cover advanced concurrency and parallelism with modern C++. This book is
hard to fully digest in a single reading because you're not likely to really
need everything it covers. I expect it to be useful in the future as I need to
refresh some specific topics.</p>
