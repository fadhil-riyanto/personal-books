                <p>The author presents seven different approaches to concurrency and parallelism,
in four different programming languages (Java, Clojure, Elixir, C / OpenCL) and
weighs them one agains the other.</p>
<p>The book starts by discussing the most obvious approach - explicit thread and
lock management, and later on shows how alternative models manage the complexity
and safety issues of this approach. Clojure is presented as an example of a
functional language which is immutable by default (through the use of efficient
persistent data structures), demonstrating its concurrency abilities through
threads (wrapped in futures and promises for convenience) and managing explicit
state with atomics and STM. Elixir (a dialect of Erlang) is shown to demonstrate
distributed, fault-tolerant programming. Then Clojure again for a presentation
of CSP (the techique that's now back in vogue thanks to Go). It finishes off
with OpenCL - a chapter that differs from the others since it discusses
parallelism at a far more detailed granularity; finally, it presents
&quot;Lambda Architecture&quot; - a collection of libraries on top of Java to implement
map-reduces and variations thereof.</p>
<p>I liked the book overall, though I do have a bit of criticism:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The code samples are not always clear, and sometimes too short. I feel the
book could be better if it spent an extra 100 pages on showing more of the
code and explaining it.</li>
<li>Related to the above, the author is very eager to use libraries for fairly
simple tasks instead of reinventing the wheel. Except that when you're
learning about a new programming paradigm, in a new programming language,
spending an extra 20 lines of text to define a function instead of importing
it is well worth the effort, IMHO.</li>
<li>Some of the Clojure samples for using CSP are outdated, even though the book
is from 2014. Functions used in the book (such as <tt class="docutils literal">map&lt;</tt>) are now marked
deprecated in Clojure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some key take-aways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Java has a very impressive array of built-in tools for concurrent and
parallel programming. Thread pools, a fork-join framework, varieties of
concurrent queues, you name it.</li>
<li>Clojure! The book helped me (re-)discover this language, and I'm very
thankful. A modern, fully-featured Lisp with a thriving, friendly community
and tons of interesting ideas - what a gem. And it implements a very
feature-full and well-designed form of CSP as a library - Lisp's macro magic
in its best. I will definitely blog more about this in the future.</li>
<li>Erlang/Elixir left me unimpressed. It seems like the biggest advantage of
these languages is in actor frameworks like OTP , which could be implemented
as a library in any modern language (JVM-based languages have Akka, for
example). Even though actors look very interesting and certainly have useful
semantics and ideas in them, the language(s) they come with are quirky and I
don't know if I wanted a new language just for distributing my
application.</li>
</ul>
