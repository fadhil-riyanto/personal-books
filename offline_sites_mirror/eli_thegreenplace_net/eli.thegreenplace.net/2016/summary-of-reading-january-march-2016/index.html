<li>&quot;Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks&quot; by Paul Butcher -
<a class="reference external" href="../book-review-seven-concurrency-models-in-seven-weeks-by-paul-butcher/index.html">full review</a>.</li>
<li>&quot;Clojure for the Brave and True&quot; by Daniel Higginbotham - an introductory book
for the Clojure programming language. Covers a fairly recent version of the
language and goes over the basics fairly thoroughly. It's hard to judge how
suitable this book would be to beginner programmers, but the author does cover
things like configuring Emacs, which could be useful for absolute beginners.
The book is full of whimsy, though it manages to be not too distracting except
in a few cases where more realistic examples would be easier to understand and
follow. In general, while I found this book to be not too bad on the basics,
it's lacking in coverage of the more complex aspects of Clojure. The coverage
of concurrency-related issues leaves much to be desired, for example. Overall,
while it's a decent book I would recommend looking for something else if you
want to get started with Clojure.</li>
<li>&quot;The Price of Privelege&quot; by Madeline Levine - secondary title is &quot;How
Parental Pressure and Material Advantage Are Creating a Generation of
Disconnected and Unhappy Kids&quot;, which pretty much summarizes the book's main
thesis. If you feel that your kids may grow up being spoiled because your own
financial situation is significantly better than what you had growing up, then
this book is for you. I think it's interesting and raises some very important
points. Specifically, the statistic of unhappiness in affluent teens it
unravels is significantly more worrying than mere &quot;being spoiled&quot;. I think
that at this stage of my life it's a bit too early because my kids are young.
It's important to start developing good habits early on, but I'll definitely
need a refresher in a few years. I found the first third of the book
especially interesting; the rest, significantly less so. That said, I did like
the book overall. I think it raises an important issue and provides some good
tips for how to handle it.</li>
<li>&quot;The Nightingale&quot; by Kristin Hannah - a long and sad book about the lives of
two sisters in France during WWII. Through them, the story of France in the
war is told - the life of a small town occupied by the Germans, and life in
the French underground that fought the Nazis throughout the war. Treatment of
French Jews, concentration camps, different natures of German officers
billeted within French homes, it's all in there. Mostly a very enjoyable read.
A couple of small parts could be better, like the initial encounters between
Isabelle and Gaetan. The author could spend a couple more pages on it. I heard
the book through its Audible version and the reading was excellent - very good
(as far as I can tell!) French pronunciation, different voices for different
characters, etc. Overall, highly recommended.</li>
<li>&quot;C++ Concurrency in Action&quot; - <a class="reference external" href="../book-review-c-concurrency-in-action-by-anthony-williams/index.html">full review</a>.</li>
<li>&quot;Structured Parallel Programming&quot; - <a class="reference external" href="../book-review-structured-parallel-programming-by-m-mccool-j-reinders-a-robinson/index.html">full review</a>.</li>
<li>&quot;The First Amendment and You&quot; by John E. Finn (audio course) - a deep dive
into the first amendment to the US constitution, examining many landmark
supreme court cases that focused on its different aspects. This book is fairly
hard core, in my opinion, as far as newbie readers go. While I think I
understood most of it, I certainly felt that a basic introduction to US law
would be a good prerequisite - getting a more formal education of how the
judicial system works (the supreme court in particular), and some basics of
how arguments in courts are structured. Overall I did enjoy the course,
though. It certainly gives you an appreciation of how complex fundamental laws
are, even when it appears that they are fairly easy and brief to define. There
are so many nuances and small difference to consider, that it's really hard
(impossible?) to come up with an axiomatic system of reasoning and one has to
rely on precedents set by past cases instead.</li>
<li>&quot;The American Revolution&quot; by Allen C. Guelzo (audio course) - a pretty
good overview of the American revolution, focusing on the military campaigns.
The course doesn't go into much depth on any one subject, so it's best seen as
an introduction and a &quot;table of contents&quot; for deeper delving into subjects of
interest.</li>
