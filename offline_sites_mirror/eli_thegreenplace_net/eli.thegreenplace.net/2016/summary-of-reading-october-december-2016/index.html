                </div>
                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; by Erich Maria Remarque - a beautiful
fictional account of the experience of war, told from the point-of-view of a
young German soldier during World War I (semi-autobiographical, I guess, based
on the author's own WWI experience). If there's one book to read to understand
what war-related PTSD comes from, this should be it. The author describes not
only the horrors of war, but also its futility, in an amazingly powerful way.
Little wonder that this book was on the black list in Nazi Germany in the
years leading to WWII. This is one of the very few books I re-read almost
immediately after finishing it for the first time.</li>
<li>&quot;Simply Einstein - Relativity Demystified&quot; by Richard Wolfson - yet another
laymen's explanation of relativity, mostly focusing on special relativity.
While this book is better than &quot;What is relativity&quot;, it suffers from the same
basic problem all books in the genre have - general relativity is explained
very vaguely with much hand-waving and little intuition. I guess some of that
is by necessity, as some things are just not very intuitive, and others
explain very complex mathematics.</li>
<li>&quot;Ego is the Enemy&quot; by Ryan Holiday - a curious mixture between ancient stoic
philosophy and a modern feel-good self help book. While it's well written and
overall entertaining to read, I didn't find this book to be very insightful.
Unfortunately, it succumbs to a very common error of the genre -- attributing
too much to the topic of focus. Many of the examples the author presents of
people who succeed and/or fail aren't convincingly ego-related, at least not
in the very specific sense the book implies. Update: it inspired me to read
the biography of Sherman, whom the author dubbed an ego-less man because he
refused the presidency after the civil war. Sherman's biography mentions very
little about his lack of ego, quite the contrary actually. It's clear that
Sherman was driven by ego in a lot of his doings, and his refusal of the
presidency is better attributed to a deep hate of politics from very young
age.</li>
<li>&quot;Fierce Patriot: The Tangled Lives of William Tecumseh Sherman&quot; by Robert
O'Connell - a biography of Sherman, well written overall. There's a lot of
interesting history in this book, since Sherman was in many important places
at the right time. Not just the civil war, but also his stint in California in
the 1840s, and also the trans-continental rail laying job after the war.</li>
<li>&quot;California: A History&quot; by Kevin Starr - this book, although of medium size,
feels too short to cover such a vast topic. Anecdotally, the same author has a
much longer book just about California in the 1950s. I do think that it's a
pretty good introduction to the topic, though. It gives a reasonable overview
for someone wishing to focus more on certain aspects or eras of the history of
the state.</li>
<li>&quot;Empire Falls&quot; by Richard Russo - a very good book about life in central
Maine in the late 90s (?) with historic flashbacks to about 20 years earlier.
Even though it has a protagonist, the actual story is really the typical town
and its population in the wake of harsh economic times, following the closure
of traditional manufacturing plants in the area.</li>
<li>&quot;How to Talk So Kids Will Listen &amp; Listen So Kids Will Talk&quot; by A. Faber,
E. Mazlish - parenting books are hard, but this one is pretty good. Lots of
interesting insights. The cartoonish tutorial-y format makes it much longer
than it should have been, IMHO, but there are definitely important ideas there
to keep in mind.</li>
<li>&quot;A More Perfect Union: An Introduction to American Government and Politics&quot; by
J. Tony Litherland - an introductory textbook covering the structure of the US
government, its constitutional basis, and how politics &quot;works&quot; in general.
It's an OK book, fun to read (for a textbook, at least) but I found it lacking
in some respects. It seems like a very large chunk of the book focuses on
history. Some of it is justified (like early colonial-age history that shaped
the constitution), but much of it isn't, and feels like filler. So while the
book does have a bunch of relevant content, it's much less than its size would
lead one to expect.</li>
<li>&quot;Law 101: Everything You Need to Know About American Law, 4th ed.&quot; by Jay
Feinman - A whirlwind tour of the first year in law school, according to the
author. The book covers a range of topics in law, giving a big-picture
overview of each. I wouldn't hope for such a book to be a page turner, and it
isn't; however, all considered the author does a good job making it readable
and not too &quot;heavy&quot;. What I liked most about it is the attempt to present
background that makes certain law topic make more sense, since law and lawyers
in general get quite a bit of heat in popular media. In particular, I found
the rationale for the way tort law works enlightening.</li>
<li>&quot;All the King's Men&quot; by Robert Penn Warren - A historical political novel,
about a governor of a Southern state (probably Alabama?) in the early 1930s,
dipping into earlier history of the narrator (the governor's right-hand man)
and the governor in the 1910s and 1920s, and also into the narrator family's
past in the late 19th century. Very well written overall, this novel tries to
depict the corruption present in the highest echelons of power in a
philosophical way. I particularly enjoyed the Boss's notion that he won't let
other &quot;dirty&quot; politicians to have anything to do with his hospital, clearly
judging his own less-than-stellar morals and ways to be on a higher level than
those of his opponents. The ending could've been better, IMHO. The book
wouldn't suffer if the last 2 chapters were cut out.</li>
<li>&quot;Clojure Applied&quot; by Ben Vandergrift and Alex Miller - I had high hopes for
this book, but was mostly disappointed. It appears to be heavily targeted
towards Java-like enterprise CRUD uses of Clojure, which both shows the least
pretty parts of the language and targets only a small subset of potential
readers. Another major gripe is that large portions of the book are spent
showing how to work with a plethora of cool-kid-of-the-day 3rd party
libraries, something I never appreciate in a book.</li>
<li>&quot;The Righteous Mind&quot; by Jonathan Haidt - what a prescient book! Written in
2012, it sets out to explain - mostly to liberals - why other political views
- mostly conservative - can make sense from a moral, psychological and even
evolutionary point of view. The author is a professor of Moral Psychology,
and the book is very well organized and carefully laid out to present
scientifically-backed fundamentals in a fairly abstract manner, before using
them to dive into the political divide in the US. Very important read for
anyone shocked by the results of the 2016 election.</li>
