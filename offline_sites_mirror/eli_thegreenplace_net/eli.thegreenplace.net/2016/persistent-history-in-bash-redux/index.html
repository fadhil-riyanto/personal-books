                <p>A couple of years ago <a class="reference external" href="../../2013/06/11/keeping-persistent-history-in-bash.html">I wrote about</a>
saving all the commands I ever ran in the terminal into a &quot;persistent history&quot;
file, for later lookup. Since some people asked me whether this ended up being
worthwhile, here's a short redux.</p>
<p>The TL;DR version is - keeping persistent history has been one of the best
productivity hacks I ever put to use; I rely on it daily, and would be much
less productive without it.</p>
<p>Before doing this, the only way I had to remember which commands/flags are
needed to run something was to write it down in all kinds of notes files,
personal wikis and so on. It was cumbersome, unorganized and time-consuming to
reuse. With the <tt class="docutils literal">.persistent_history</tt> file automatically populated by Bash
from any terminal I'm typing into, and being kept in a Git repository for
safekeeping, I have quick access to any command I ever ran. It's a life safer
for someone who spends as much time in the terminal as me. I warmly recommend
it, or some equivalent approach, to anyone who is using Linux daily.</p>
<p>Interestingly, at the time of the original post I was worried that with time
this file will grow too long and will have to be trimmed. That turned out to be
a completely needless worry. In over two years of using it at work, my
<tt class="docutils literal">.persistent_history</tt> is somewhat over 6 MB long, with ~60000 lines <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>. It
takes a negligible amount of time to append to it and to search within it (15
milliseconds for a full search is the most I was able to measure). It doesn't
even matter if you have a SSD or a hard drive as your main storage device; since
the file is continously written to, it's almost certainly paged into memory most
of the time anyway.</p>
<p>Also, I posted a histogram of the 10 most commonly used commands on my home
machine for hobby hacking, so it's interesting to revisit that. Here's a
histogram for the past year:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git          : 1564
ls           : 861
gs           : 669
cd           : 546
vi           : 543
make         : 538
ll           : 388
pssc         : 379
PYTHONPATH=. : 337
python       : 286
</pre></div>
<p>As the original post foresaw, the impending switch from Mercurial to Git for my
personal projects, along with spending much less time on CPython core
development have pushed <tt class="docutils literal">hg</tt> to the fringes, and Git is certainly the most
used command now (<tt class="docutils literal">gs</tt> is my alias for <tt class="docutils literal">git status</tt>). Python should be
higher than it appears because commands starting with <tt class="docutils literal">PYTHONPATH=.</tt> always
precede <tt class="docutils literal">python</tt>. The rest is a fairly expected bunch from a terminal hermit.
<tt class="docutils literal">pssc</tt> is one of the aliases I use for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/pss">pss</a>,
which is why you don't see <tt class="docutils literal">grep</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">find</tt> in the list.</p>
<p>I placed the Bash code enabling persistent history, along with the Python script
I used to compute the command usage histogram shown above <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/main/2016/persistent-history">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="footnote-1" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#footnote-reference-1">[1]</a></td><td>In reality there were likely many more commands, but the script does some
amount of de-duplication - it won't write down a command if it's exactly
the same as the last one written. For example, if you spend the whole
day hacking in an editor and rerunning <tt class="docutils literal">python foo.py</tt> every couple of
minutes, the only commands that will be written in the history are
opening the editor and then a single instance of <tt class="docutils literal">python foo.py</tt>.</td></tr>
