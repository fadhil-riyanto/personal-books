                <p>There's a long list of books about Go on the market already, and I was almost
tempted to get one to dive into Go a bit more formally and thoroughly than the
couple of small forays I've made so far. However, once &quot;The Go Programming
Language&quot; (GOPL) appeared, it became pretty clear that this is the book to get,
simply because of the authors: Alan Donovan is a long-time Go team member at
Google; Brian Kernighan is... well, Brian Kernighan. Having now read the book
cover-to-cover over the course of a few weeks and having worked through a large
portion of the exercises, I can gladly say I wasn't disappointed.</p>
<p>It's hard to escape the book's resemblance to the great K&amp;R, both because of the
same K, the name of the book, and its general structure which is very
similar. I'm pretty sure this is intentional, and hey why not? K&amp;R is still
considered a classic in programming literature, for a good reason.</p>
<p>There weren't as many books in the 1980s as there are today, and unfortunately
it's very common nowadays for books to try to differentiate themselves with all
kinds of cutesy themes, forcefully &quot;geeky&quot; examples, being &quot;for dummies&quot; or &quot;in
24 hours&quot; and so on. GOPL does none of that. It retains the clear, crisp,
to-the-point tone of K&amp;R, without any distracting cuteness or silly metaphors.
It recognizes that a small synthetic example is absolutely fine, and dressing it
up to look as a comic book can just distract one from the actual code.</p>
<p>After an introductory chapter that races through Go with some interesting
examples to whet the reader's appetite, the language is methodically unraveled.
The authors make sure not only to present language features, but provide
justifications and common conventions. Some sections go more in-depth than
others, and can serve as useful references later on, after the first reading.</p>
<p>Go is an opinionated language, and GOPL is an opinionated book. Both have the
right to be, IMHO, due to the innate authority of their authors as veterans in
the field who distill their collective experience into the language and the
book.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed GOPL a lot. If you're looking to get a thorough and serious
introduction to the Go programming language, I think it's an excellent choice.</p>
