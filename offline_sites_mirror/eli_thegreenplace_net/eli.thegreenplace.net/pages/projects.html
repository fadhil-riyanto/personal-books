  It's a showcase of projects I initiated myself and have written the vast
  majority of the code for; there are very few exceptions here - projects I
  either started together with another person, or didn't initiate but currently
  maintain - these are explicitly called out in the list.
  </p>

        <img src="../images/pages/py.svg" style="height: 20px" />
        </p>
        <p><a href="../2008/11/15/pycparser-v10-is-out.html">Originally released in 2008</a>,
        pycparser is now the most commonly used Python parser for the C
        programming language. It's used in <a href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">CFFI</a>,
        and through it in other prominent Python projects like
        <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/">pycryptography</a>. The
        following are some additional uses of pycparser, taken from real user
        reports:
        <ul>
          <li>C code obfuscator</li>
          <li>Front-end for various specialized C compilers</li>
          <li>Static code checker</li>
          <li>Automatic unit-test discovery</li>
          <li>Adding specialized extensions to the C programming language</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        pycparser's input is pre-processed C source code, and its output is
        an AST data structure. It also comes with a code generator that emits
        C back from the parsed AST.

        </p>
        <p>
        A Python library for parsing and analyzing ELF files and DWARF debugging
        information, <a href="../2012/01/06/pyelftools-python-library-for-parsing-elf-and-dwarf.html">originally released in 2012</a>.
        pyelftools provides both low-level and high-level APIs for querying ELF and DWARF,
        and as a proof of capability ships with with a fairly powerful clone
        of the <code>readelf</code> command-line tool.</p>
        <p>This <code>readelf</code> clone is also used for an extensive
        test suite that compares pyelftools to the original tool taken from <code>binutils</code>.
        This is important to maintain high implementation fidelity since DWARF
        is a notoriously difficult format to parse.
        </p>
        <p>
        pyelftools is widely used by embedded developers as part of custom
        toolchains and also in the security community to analyze
        binaries for exploits.

        </p>
        <p>
        When developing web applications locally, for basic test cases we can
        open an HTML file directly in the browser (using the <code>file:///</code> scheme).
        However, this is sometimes insufficient, and in several scenarios it's
        necessary to properly serve the HTML (along with its JS and CSS). Some
        cases where I encountered this are web applications that use at least
        one of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Web workers</li>
          <li>Web sockets</li>
          <li>WASM</li>
          <li>Separate API servers, requiring CORS</li>
          <li>Loading ES modules from separate files</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        static-server is a static file server with useful defaults and some
        advanced options (like CORS and TLS); it can be installed or
        <code>go run</code> without installing, and very easy to use.

        <p>
        Given a Python function that performs a mathematical computation using

        the derivative of this function (as well as higher-order derivatives).

        <p>
        A re-implementation of the

        using Python and the llvmlite library.
        </p>

        <p>
        The tutorial builds a simple programming language called Kaleidoscope,
        including a parser and code generator using LLVM. My project
        follows the tutorial chapter by chapter, and produces a working
        implementation of the Kaleidoscope language that includes parsing,
        code generation and execution.
        </p>

        <p>
        Pykaleidoscope uses the llvmlite bindings to LLVM to build LLVM IR from
        the AST, optimize this IR and then compile it to a runtime-executable
        blob of native code. The result is an evaluator for Kaleidoscope,
        embedded in Python.

        </p>
        <p>
        A command-line tool for recursive <code>grep</code>-ing inside programming projects.
        It knows about the extensions of common programming languages and
        searches only in the right files; it also knows to ignore directories
        like <code>.git</code> and <code>__pycache__</code>.
        For example, <code>pss --py Enum</code> will
        search for <code>Enum</code>, recursively starting from the current
        directory; it will search only in <code>.py</code> and <code>.pyw</code>
        files (the latter is sometimes used on Windows).

        <b><a href="https://github.com/eliben/luz-cpu">luz-cpu</a>
          - a CPU simulator, with an assembler and linker</b>
        <img src="../images/pages/py.svg" style="height: 20px" />
        </p>
        <p>
        Luz is a custom 32-bit RISC CPU, created for educational purposes.
        It's designed to be an embedded CPU with custom memory-mapped
        peripherals, and comes with a few sample peripherals; more can
        be plugged in using a simple interface.
        </p>
        <p>
        This project includes a functional simulator for the Luz CPU. The
        simulator requires a binary image of the program to run, containing
        binary-encoded Luz machine language. To program the CPU, the project
        provides an assembler and a linker.
        </p>
        <p>
        The assembler takes mnemonic assembly input and compiles it to an
        object file with machine code.
        The assembly language is fairly standard and should be familiar
        to anyone who writes assembly code for RISC CPUs.
        </p>
        <p>
        The linker enables enables separate compilation, by linking multiple
        object files into a single binary image; it resolves relocations to
        support function calls and data references across object files.

        It's a study of implementing simple JIT compilers.

        <p>
        It includes several interpreters with increasing level of optimization,
        a from-scratch JIT compiler written in C++,

        <p>
        ESMS is a simulator for fantasy soccer leagues; it hails from the
        play-by-email fantasy leagues of the 1990s. While this project
        has been in <a href="../2007/06/29/the-end-of-the-road-for-esms/index.html">unmtaintained mode for a really long time now</a>,
        I'm still listing it here since it holds a special place in my heart.
        </p>
        <p>
        First of all, it was popular! In its heyday, ESMS was used by hundreds
        of leagues and thousands of people in fantasy soccer communities. And
        that's in the 1990s, when the internet was a much smaller place.
        </p>
        <p>
        And second, this was my first major programming project, going all the
        way back to 1998 (keep that in mind if you examine the code!). I started
        this project together with a friend and we hacked on it together for a
        year or so, after which I kept maintaining and improving it for a few
        additional years.
