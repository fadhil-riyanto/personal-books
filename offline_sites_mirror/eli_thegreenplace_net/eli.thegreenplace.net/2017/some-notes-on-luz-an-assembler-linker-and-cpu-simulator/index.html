                <p>A few years ago I <a class="reference external" href="../../2010/05/05/introducing-luz.html">wrote about Luz</a> - a
self-educational project to implement a CPU simulator and a toolchain for it,
consisting of an assembler and a linker. Since then, I received some questions
by email that made me realize I could do a better job explaining what the
project is and what one can learn from it.</p>
<p>So I went back to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/luz-cpu">Luz repository</a> and
fixed it up to be more modern, in-line with current documentation standards on
GitHub. The landing <cite>README</cite> page should now provide a good overview, but I also
wanted to write up some less formal documentation I could point to - a place to
show-off some of the more interesting features in Luz; a blog post seemed like
the perfect medium for this.</p>
<p>As before, it makes sense to start with the Luz toplevel diagram:</p>
<img alt="Luz toplevel diagram" class="align-center" src="../../images/2010/05/luz_proj_toplevel.png" />
<p>Luz is a collection of related libraries and programs written in Python,
implementing all the stages shown in the diagram above.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-cpu-simulator">
<h2>The CPU simulator</h2>
<p>The Luz CPU is inspired by MIPS (for the instruction set), by Altera Nios II
(for the way &quot;peripherals&quot; are attached to the CPU), and by MPC 555 (for the
memory controller) and is aimed at embedded uses, like Nios II. The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/luz-cpu/blob/main/doc/luz_user_manual.rst">Luz user
manual</a>
lists the complete instruction set explaining what each instructions means.</p>
<p>The simulator itself is functional only - it performs the instructions one after
the other, without trying to simulate how long their execution takes. It's not
very remarkable and is designed to be simple and readable. The most interesting
feature it has, IMHO, is how it maps &quot;peripherals&quot; and even CPU control
registers into memory. Rather than providing special instructions or traps for
OS system calls, Luz facilitates &quot;bare-metal&quot; programming (by which I mean,
without an OS) by mapping &quot;peripherals&quot; into memory, allowing the programmer to
access them by reading and writing special memory locations.</p>
<p>My inspiration here was soft-core embeddable CPUs like Nios II, which let you
configure what peripherals to connect and how to map them. The CPU can be
configured before it's loaded onto real HW, for example to attach as many SPI
interfaces as needed. For Luz, to create a new peripheral and attach it to the
simulator one implements the <tt class="docutils literal">Peripheral</tt> interface:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Peripheral</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot; An abstract memory-mapped perhipheral interface.</span>
<span class="sd">        Memory-mapped peripherals are accessed through memory</span>
<span class="sd">        reads and writes.</span>

<span class="sd">        The address given to reads and writes is relative to the</span>
<span class="sd">        peripheral&#39;s memory map.</span>
<span class="sd">        Width is 1, 2, 4 for byte, halfword and word accesses.</span>

        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">NotImplementedError</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Luz implements some built-in features as peripherals as well; for example, the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/luz-cpu/blob/main/luz_asm_sim/lib/simlib/peripheral/coreregisters.py">core registers</a>
(interrupt control, exception control, etc). The idea here is that embedded CPUs
can have multiple custom &quot;registers&quot; to control various features, and creating
dedicated names for them bloats instruction encoding (you need 5 bits to encode
one of 32 registers, etc.); it's better to just map them to memory.</p>
<p>Another example is the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/luz-cpu/blob/main/luz_asm_sim/lib/simlib/peripheral/debugqueue.py">debug queue</a>
- a peripheral useful for testing and debugging. It's a single word mapped to
address <tt class="docutils literal">0xF0000</tt> in the simulator. When the peripheral gets a write, it
stores it in a special queue and optionally emits the value to stdout. The
queue can later be examined. Here is a simple Luz assembly program that makes
use of it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Counts from 0 to 9 [inclusive], pushing these numbers into the debug queue

    .segment code
    .global asm_main

    .define ADDR_DEBUG_QUEUE, 0xF0000

asm_main:
    li $k0, ADDR_DEBUG_QUEUE

    li $r9, 10                          # r9 is the loop limit
    li $r5, 0                           # r5 is the loop counter

loop:
    sw $r5, 0($k0)                      # store loop counter to debug queue
    addi $r5, $r5, 1                    # increment loop counter
    bltu $r5, $r9, loop                 # loop back if not reached limit

    halt
</pre></div>
<p>Using the interactive runner to run this program we get:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python run_test_interactive.py loop_simple_debugqueue

<div class="section" id="assembler">
<h2>Assembler</h2>
<p>There's a small snippet of Luz assembly shown above. It's your run-of-the-mill
RISC assembly, with the familiar set of instructions, fairly simple addressing
modes and almost every instruction requiring registers (note how we can't store
into the debug queue directly, for example, without dereferencing a register
that holds its address).</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/luz-cpu/blob/main/doc/luz_user_manual.rst">Luz user manual</a>
contains a complete reference for the instructions, including their encodings.
Every instruction is a 32-bit word, with the 6 high bits for the opcode (meaning
up to 64 distinct instructions are supported).</p>
<p>The code snippet also shows off some special features of the full Luz toolchain,
like the special label <tt class="docutils literal">asm_main</tt>. I'll discuss these later on in the section
about linking.</p>
<p>Assembly languages are usually fairly simple to parse, and Luz is no exception.
When I started working on Luz, I decided to use the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/">PLY</a> library for the lexer and parser mainly because I
wanted to play with it. These days I'd probably just hand-roll a parser.</p>
<p>Luz takes another cool idea from MIPS - <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/sum2003/cmsc311/Notes/Mips/altReg.html">register aliases</a>. While
the assembler doesn't enforce any specific ABI on the coder, some conventions are
very important when writing large assembly programs, and especially when
interfacing with routines written by other programmers. To facilitate this, Luz
designates register aliases for callee-saved registers and temporary registers.</p>
<p>For example, the general-purpose register number 19 can be referred to in Luz
assembly as <tt class="docutils literal">$r19</tt> but also as <tt class="docutils literal">$s1</tt> - the callee-saved register 1. When
writing standalone Luz programs, one is free to ignore these conventions. To
get a taste of how ABI-conformant Luz assembly would look, take a look at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/luz-cpu/tree/main/luz_asm_sim/tests_full/procedure_call_stack_convention">this example</a>.</p>
<p>To be honest, ABI was on my mind because I was initially envisioning a full
programming environment for Luz, including a C compiler. When you have a
compiler, you must have some set of conventions for generated code like
procedure parameter passing, saved registers and so on; in other words, the
platform ABI.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linker">
<h2>Linker</h2>
<p>In my view, one of the distinguishing features of Luz from other assembler
projects out there is the linker. Luz features a full linker that supports
creating single &quot;binaries&quot; from multiple assembly files, handling all the dirty
work necessary to make that happen. Each assembly file is first &quot;assembled&quot; into
a position-independent object file; these are glued together by the linker which
applies the necessary relocations to resolve symbols across object files. The
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/luz-cpu/tree/main/luz_asm_sim/tests_full/prime_sieve">prime sieve example</a>
shows this in action - the program is divided into three <tt class="docutils literal">.lasm</tt> files: two
for subroutines and one for &quot;main&quot;.</p>
<p>As we've seen above, the main subroutine in Luz is called <tt class="docutils literal">asm_main</tt>. This is
a special name for the linker (not unlike the <tt class="docutils literal">_start</tt> symbol for <a class="reference external" href="../../2012/08/13/how-statically-linked-programs-run-on-linux.html">modern
Linux assemblers</a>).
The linker collects a set of object files produced by assembly, and makes sure
to invoke <tt class="docutils literal">asm_main</tt> from the special location <tt class="docutils literal">0x100000</tt>. This is where
the simulator starts execution.</p>
<p>Luz also has the concept of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/luz-cpu/blob/main/luz_asm_sim/lib/asmlib/objectfile.py">object files</a>.
They are not unlike ELF images in nature: there's a segment table, an export
table and a relocation table for each object, serving the expected roles. It is
the job of the linker to make sense in this list of objects and correctly
connect all call sites to final subroutine addresses.</p>
<p>Luz's <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/luz-cpu/blob/main/luz_asm_sim/luz_asm.py">standalone assembler</a> can
write an assembled image into a file in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX">Intel HEX format</a>, a popular format used in embedded
systems to encode binary images or data in ASCII.</p>
<p>The linker was quite a bit of effort to develop. Since all real Luz programs are
small I didn't really need to break them up into multiple assembly files; but
I really wanted to learn how to write a real linker :) Moreover, as already
mentioned my original plans for Luz included a C compiler, and that would make a
linker very helpful, since I'd need to link some &quot;system&quot; code into the user's
program. Even today, Luz has some &quot;startup code&quot; it links into every image:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># The special segments added by the linker.
# __startup: 3 words
# __heap: 1 word
#
LINKER_STARTUP_CODE = string.Template(r&#39;&#39;&#39;
        .segment __startup

    LI      $$sp, ${SP_POINTER}
    CALL    asm_main

        .segment __heap
        .global __heap
    __heap:
        .word 0
&#39;&#39;&#39;)
</pre></div>
<p>This code sets up the stack pointer to the initial address allocated for the
stack, and calls the user's <tt class="docutils literal">asm_main</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debugger-and-disassembler">
<h2>Debugger and disassembler</h2>
<p>Luz comes with a simple program runner that will execute a Luz program
(consisting of multiple assembly files); it also has an interactive mode - a
debugger. Here's a sample session with the simple loop example shown above:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python run_test_interactive.py -i loop_simple_debugqueue

<p>There are many interesting things here demonstrating how Luz works:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Note the start up at <tt class="docutils literal">0x1000000</tt> - this is where Luz places the start-up
segment - three instructions that set up the stack pointer and then <tt class="docutils literal">call</tt>
the user's code (<tt class="docutils literal">asm_main</tt>). The user's <tt class="docutils literal">asm_main</tt> starts running at
the fourth instruction executed by the simulator.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">li</tt> is a pseudo-instruction, broken into two real instructions: <tt class="docutils literal">lui</tt>
for the upper half of the register, followed by <tt class="docutils literal">ori</tt> for the lower half of
the register. The reason for this is <tt class="docutils literal">li</tt> having a 32-bit immediate, which
can't fit in a Luz instruction. Therefore, it's broken into two parts which
only need 16-bit immediates. This trick is common in RISC ISAs.</li>
<li>Jump labels are resolved to be relative by the assembler: the jump to <tt class="docutils literal">loop</tt>
is replaced by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-2</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Disassembly! The debugger shows the instruction decoded from every word where
execution stops. Note how this exposes pseudo-instructions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-in-progress-rtl-implementation">
<h2>The in-progress RTL implementation</h2>
<p>Luz was a hobby project, but an ambitious one :-) Even before I wrote the first
line of the assembler or simulator, I started working on an actual CPU
implementation in synthesizable VHDL, meaning to get a complete RTL image to run
on FPGAs. Unfortunately, I didn't finish this part of the project
and what you find in Luz's <tt class="docutils literal">experimental/luz_uc</tt> directory is only 75%
complete. The ALU is there, the registers, the hookups to peripherals, even
parts of the control path - dealing with instruction fetching, decoding, etc. My
original plan was to implement a pipelined CPU (a RISC ISA makes this relatively
simple), which perhaps was a bit too much. I should have started simpler.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Luz was an extremely educational project for me. When I started working on it,
I mostly had embedded programming experience and was just starting to get
interested in systems programming. Luz flung me into the world of assemblers,
linkers, binary images, calling conventions, and so on. Besides, Python was
a new language for me at the time - Luz started just months after
<a class="reference external" href="../../2008/05/14/python.html">I first got into Python</a>.</p>
<p>Its ~8000 lines of Python code are thus likely not my best Python code, but they
should be readable and well commented. I did modernize it a bit over the years,
for example to make it run on both Python 2 and 3.</p>
<p>I still hope to get back to the RTL implementation project one day. It's really
very close to being able to run realistic assembly programs on <em>real hardware</em>

generation backend to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/pycparser">pycparser</a>. Maybe
I'll still fulfill it one day :-)</p>
