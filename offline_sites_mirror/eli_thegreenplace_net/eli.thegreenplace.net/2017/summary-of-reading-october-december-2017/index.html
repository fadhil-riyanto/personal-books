                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;How Asia Works&quot; by Joe Studwell - an interesting analysis of the economies
of some Asian countries and their paths from rags to riches in the last few
decades. The author raises some intriguing questions about the paths the most
successful countries taken as compared to the free market approach the great
powers tried to enforce upon them, and ends with some speculation on the
future of China's financial development.</li>
<li>&quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; by Kazuo Ishiguro - a truly delightful book, I have
no other word to describe it :) Having watched and enjoyed &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;
just a short while ago, it was very interesting to draw the similarities with
the world Ishiguro describes in this book - the world of British nobles and
their servants.</li>
<li>&quot;Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis&quot; by J.D.
Vance - the author tells about growing up in a troubled family in the rust
belt, and eventual &quot;escape&quot; to the Marine Corps and Yale law school.
Interestingly, while I originally expected something different from the book,
I did like it overall. It doesn't carry a lot of insight besides the very
personal story, but perhaps such insight <em>is</em> best gained through individual
stories and not editorial pieces that are prone to political biases.</li>
<li>&quot;Between the World and Me&quot; by Ta-Nehisi Coates - a troubling auto-biographic
account of the author growing up as a black man in Baltimore and later through
studies in Howard University. Reading this book is difficult and poignant, as
it paints an angry picture of the racial divide in modern-day America.</li>
<li>&quot;Exit Right: The People Who Left the Left and Reshaped the American Century&quot;
by Daniel Oppenheimer - a biographical account of 6 prominent Americans from
the political left, their gradual estrangement from their party and eventual
flip to conservatism (or neoconservatism). Provides a fairly interesting angle
on major issues American politics of the 20th century.</li>
<li>&quot;Little Fires Everywhere&quot; by Celeste Ng - a well-to-do family in Cleveland
intersects with a nomad artist and her daughter, with a thorny adoption story
in the background. Somewhat soap-opera-y, but not bad overall, with some
interesting thoughts on choosing life paths.</li>
<li>&quot;To Make Men Free - A history of the Republican party&quot; by Heather Cox
Richardson - a detailed history of the Republican party from the times of
Lincoln and until the end of Bush Jr's presidency. Very informative book
overall, but far from great. For one, it's clearly biased towards the left -
and bias makes such books lose a lot of credence; for another, it completely
ignores the changes in the Democratic party - for example, very little is said
about how the Democrats turned from racism to liberalism in the 1960s. In
fact, the author insinuates that most of the changes in the political spectrum
were either made by the Republicans, or as a mirror image of their views;
clearly, the truth can't be so simple. On the positive side, I liked the
exposition of the inherent conflict between the Declaration of Independence
(equality of opportunity) and the Constitution (protection of property), which
may help explain why there's no easy answers in American politics.</li>
<li>&quot;The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals&quot; by Michael
Pollan - a really well written book about the current industrial food chain,
organic foods, &quot;free-range&quot; farm foods and also modern hunter-gathering. I
liked the balanced approach and the book not being too preachy even though the
conclusions are fairly clear.</li>
<li>&quot;Programming Haskell&quot; by Graham Hutton (2nd ed.) -
<a class="reference external" href="../book-review-programming-in-haskell-by-graham-hutton-2nd-ed/index.html">full review</a>.</li>
<li>&quot;The Namesake&quot; by Jhumpa Lahiri - this time a full-length novel about the
same topic of Bengal immigrants to the US in the 1970s, following their life
through the early 2000s. The protagonist is Gogol, born in Boston to immigrant
parents, trying to have a normative American life in the late 20th century. I
liked the first ~half of the book much more, as it was more tied to Lahiri's
main immigrant theme. The second half felt like a fairly generic
&quot;coming-of-age&quot; story for a young intellectual in New York. Still a good read
overall, though.</li>
<li>&quot;The Vital Question&quot; by Nick Lane - another grand-sweeping account of
fundamental bio-chemistry and evolution mixed with speculative musings on the
big questions of the origin of life by Nick Lane. My opinion of this book is
similar to that of the author's <em>Life Ascending</em> - really well written, tons
of knowledge, but way too dense and way too speculative. I'd say the minimal
education level for really understanding this book is being a grad student in
biology or a related field; otherwise it's fairly hard to judge where the
facts end and where the speculation begins. I did enjoy the book overall,
however - there's tons of fascinating details in it that just aren't covered
anywhere else in popular science.</li>
<li>&quot;In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto&quot; by Michael Pollan - the book that
gave birth to the saying &quot;Eat food, not too much, mostly plants&quot;. A nice and
pragmatic treatment of the important question of &quot;what should we eat&quot;.</li>
