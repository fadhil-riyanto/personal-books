                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;The Second Shift: Working Families and the Revolution at Home&quot; by Arlie
Hochschild - Discusses the topic of the home life of families with two working
parents and small children. This is very close to my heart, so I read the book
avidly. It's pretty interesting overall, though falls short of great due to a
somewhat boring last third and being outdated. It was written in the 1980s and
I'd be very curious to read a modern account; since (by the author's own
admission) this whole aspect of society is undergoing rapid change, I imagine
the situation may be somewhat different 30 years later.</li>
<li>&quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; by Richard Russo - A fictional account of the lives of several
inhabitants of a small town in a decaying part of up-state New York, in the
1980s. Very good writing, even though there's not a single likable character
in the whole book! The ambiance resembles &quot;Empire Falls&quot; overall - an
enjoyable read.</li>
<li>&quot;The Everything American Government Book&quot; by Nick Ragone - pretty good
overview of how the government in the US works, from federal to state to
local. It goes breadth-first rather to depth, mostly serving as an extended
introduction to a wide range of topics.</li>
<li>&quot;The Beginning of Infinity&quot; by David Deutsch - an ambitious sweep across
biology, artificial intelligence, history of science, politics and quantum
mechanics with an optimistic flavor. &quot;Infinity&quot; refers to the possibilities
opened by the current open, scientific society. While the idea of the book is
enticing and some parts in it are very interesting, some other parts are
outright weird and very loosely related to the main theme. Specifically, from
one of the fathers of quantum computing I would expect a better explanation of
the many-world interpretation.</li>
<li>&quot;1984&quot; by George Orwell - technically a re-read, but since I read this book
before 2003 I never really wrote a review. I liked this book, overall. It's
mostly fun to read, if you ignore all the parts that make no sense. Still,
it's thought provoking in the positive sense and well worth a read if you've
never read similar negative Utopias before. Studying a bit of history first
would help though, since I imagine most young people these days (thankfully!)
aren't even aware of the ideology dramatized in the book.</li>
<li>&quot;Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race and Family Life&quot; by Annette Lareau - a
sociological study of 3rd grade students and their families, focusing on the
differences between social classes (middle class, working class, poor) and
race; conducted in the mid 1990s. Pretty interesting account of the different
life experiences of kids and parents; I found some accounts of middle-class
kids troubling (over-scheduling), and accounts of poor-class kids scary in a
different way (formidable financial struggles).</li>
<li>&quot;The Working Dad's Survival Guide: How to Succeed at Work and at Home&quot; by
Scott Behson - a book by the author of the <a class="reference external" href="http://fathersworkandfamily.com/">Fathers, Work and Family blog</a>, focusing on work-life balance for
fathers who want to spend as much time as possible with family. A pretty good
book overall, though a bit too self-help-y. I think the main encouragement
coming from reading it is the realization that this is a common issue quite a
few men are facing this problem nowadays.</li>
<li>&quot;The Plague&quot; by Albert Camus - Fictional account about an outbreak of bubonic
plague in a French city in coastal Algiers in the 1930s. A bit too
philosophical and scattered to my taste. Not a bad read, but far from great.</li>
<li>&quot;Essentials of Programming Languages&quot; by D. Friedman and M. Wand -
<a class="reference external" href="../book-review-essentials-of-programming-languages-by-d-friedman-and-m-wand/index.html">full review</a>.</li>
<li>&quot;Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises&quot; by Timothy Geithner - an
auto-biographic account of the former secretary of treasury and president of
the NY Fed, describing his career in public service with a strong focus on the
2007-2009 financial crisis. A really excellent book - strikingly honest and
well balanced. I found it very inspiring w.r.t. facing adversity and making
hard decisions even if they can't be popular. Highly recommended.</li>
<li>&quot;Hidden Figures&quot; by Margot Lee Shetterly - The book upon which the movie is
based. I was surprised at how different the book is - it's a heavily
researched biography, non-fictional. In retrospect, it makes perfect sense how
they condensed the story into the movie, since such books don't really make
for great Hollywood hits as-is (maybe documentaries). Regardless, both the
book and the movie are great, in my opinion. Very cool example of cold, hard
economics at work - how practical needs and competition with external powers
made gentle but real cracks in the segregational craze of the South -
especially in Virginia, which was one of the most ardent strongholds of
segregation well into the second half of the 20th century.</li>
<li>&quot;The Forgotten Man&quot; by Amity Shlaes - a history of the great depression and
the New Deal, up until the middle of WWII. I was hoping to find some more
economic insights in this book about why the great depression lasted so long,
whether the New Deal made it better or worse, and what ultimately ended it.
While the book is interesting and easy to read, I ended up being disappointed
in these hopes since I didn't find much coherent explanation here. The author
sort-of hints at possible causes and effects (from a conservative economic
point of view) but doesn't really develop these thoughts into anything
concrete. It's still not a bad book as a history of the USA in the 1930s, but
I'll have to find some other source for economic insights.</li>
<li>&quot;Work Rules&quot; by Laszlo Bock - Laszlo was Google's head of people operations
(a.k.a. HR) for many years, and in this book he tells about the Google culture
and approach to hiring, employee development and management. It's a pretty
good book, and a fairly accurate description of how this aspect of Google
ticks.</li>
<li>&quot;Predictably Irrational&quot; by Dan Ariely - a very good and entertaining book
exploring the irrational nature of human beings. The author describes his
research in behavioral psychology, featuring many experiments that probe how
people behave in various scenarios; these experiments unearth many instances
of &quot;irrational&quot; behavior in the sense that people don't strictly act by
maximizing their utility.</li>
<li>&quot;Interpreter of Maladies&quot; by Jhumpa Lahiri - a collection of short stories
about Indian immigrants (or children thereof) in the USA; a couple of the
stories describe life in Calcutta. In general, all people in the book come
from the Calcutta area, and in the US usually live in the New England area.
Very good writing - each story, even if very short, is immediately
captivating - I'd be happy to read a full novel based on each one. Very
interesting glimpse into the lives of Americans of Indian origin and their
view on the US society and way of life.</li>
