                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;The history of the Supreme Court&quot; by Peter Irons (audio course) - a
comprehensive history of the US Supreme Court, focusing on the most
influential judges and the most seminal decisions it made over the years. I
liked the latter parts of the book better than the former, except hearing
about the lecturer's own opinion on the cases a bit too much for my taste. I
expected a more objective historic treatment.</li>
<li>&quot;The Three Comrades&quot; by Erich Maria Remarque - a somewhat dark, but
well-written novel about life in Germany in the years after WWI. Not quite as
good as the Western Front, but still enjoyable. I wonder how much money the
main character would have if he just wouldn't drink so much, but that probably
doesn't matter in the long term. I just seem to have something against books
focused on drinking (this is why I find Hemingway painful to read).</li>
<li>&quot;Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right&quot; by
Arlie Russell Hochschild - Set to understand the paradox of many &quot;red state&quot;
voters in voting against their apparent interests (in terms of public
services, welfare and environmental issues), the author - a liberal Berkeley
professor - went to Louisiana to befriend some of its inhabitants and to
bridge the &quot;empathy wall&quot; between left and right. Very timely book with the
recent election results. I wouldn't say the book fully answers the big
question, but it does provide some interesting and useful clues. The most
insightful observation is the &quot;cutting in line&quot; theory, in which white,
working Christian males from the south see their status in society continually
eroded by granting rights and recognition to other segments of the
population - blacks, women, poor folks on welfare and most recently LGBT; the
latter, along with abortions go against these voters' notion of a normative
family, and makes their deepest traditions seem under attack. It's not very
clear what the actionable conclusions from this book might be, but it
definitely is a good attempt to help left-wing liberals understand what drives
folks on the other side of the divide.</li>
<li>&quot;The Words We Live By&quot; by Linda R. Monk - this is an annotated guide to the US
constitution. The constitution is spread out across 270 (large) pages, article
by article, section by section, interspersed with historical background,
relevant supreme court cases and quotes from politicians, judges and notable
activists. Very nicely put together - this book is pretty interesting to just
read cover-to-cover, and can serve as a good introductory reference material
to the constitution as well.</li>
<li>&quot;The Blessing of a Skinned Knee&quot; by Wendy Mogel - nominally, this is a
parenting book written by a child psychologist but focusing mostly on
learnings from Jewish tradition and religious texts. In the role of a
parenting book I found it fairly average - it lists some good ideas I agree
with, but suffers from evanescence typical of self-help books. However, in a
role of conveying the important of religion and tradition to overall family
life and well-being, I found it intriguing. I doubt I can bring myself to do
the leap of faith necessary to follow the author's path, but I found these
parts of the book thought provoking nevertheless.</li>
<li>&quot;The Gene: An Intimate History&quot; by Siddhartha Mukherjee - good, but not great,
book about genetics. I was very happy when the historical coverage appeared to
have ended shortly after the middle of the book, anticipating lots of
interesting reading about modern research. However, at that point the author
spent too much paper talking about the moral implications of genetic research,
rather than focusing on the science itself. The writing is excellent, but for
me this book didn't really stand out among the crowd of other books on this
subject.</li>
<li>&quot;1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus&quot; by Charles C.
Mann - this book is set to attack the myth that prior to the arrival
Europeans, native Americans were sparsely settled in small populations that
didn't affect the environment too much. It provides evidence and
historical/archaeological research in favor of much larger populations that
shaped their environment and developed highly complex cultures. The book is
nice to read, but I found many of the arguments unconvincing (although I
wanted to be convinced). It seems like there's a dearth of real scientific
data, and a lot of &quot;proof&quot; relies on badly preserved verbal accounts of
various European explorers and ambiguous archaeological findings. Some of the
arguments are more convincing, like the extent to which European disease
decimated local populations. For some reason the book also spends lots of
pages recounting various native American myths and folk stories, which feels
absolutely unnecessary. It would be a better, albeit shorter book without
this.</li>
<li>&quot;The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature&quot; by Steven Pinker -
somewhat long-winded treatise on the genetic vs. environmental factors
involved in the psychological development of humans. Lots of pages spent
flaming opposing works, which may make someone feel on the scientific edge,
but I personally felt wasn't that interesting. All in all, I found this book
less interesting and useful than previous books I read on this and similar
topics. One notable mention is Pinker's treatment of post-modernism in art.
Specifically, it suddenly hit me that post-modernism is precisely what Any
Rand was mocking in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot; by Thomas Sowell - one of the densest and least
readable books I've encountered in the past few years. The laconic audio
narration didn't help here. The ideas Sowell presents are interesting, with
the caveat that you can never divide something so complex into two categories
cleanly. It's certainly a brave attempt at digging up the real roots of the
differences between conservatives and liberals. That said, it utterly fails to
explain mixed views some people hold that are part-conservative and
part-liberal (myself included).</li>
