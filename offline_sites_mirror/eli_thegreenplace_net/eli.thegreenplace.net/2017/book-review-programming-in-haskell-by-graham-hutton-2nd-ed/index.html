                <p>It's hard not to run into Graham Hutton's work when reading about functional
programming, so reading a book on Haskell written by him sounded like a good
opportunity to learn from a real expert. It turned out to be a good choice -
this is definitely the best Haskell book I read so far.</p>
<p>The author's deep understanding of functional programming concepts and Haskell
shines through the writing on many occasions. He carefully sets up explanations
and examples that build one on top of another, and manages to explain some of
the thorniest ideas of Haskell (applicatives and monads, I'm looking at you)
very clearly; most importantly, the <em>why</em> of things is often explained, along
with some important historical background that sheds some light on the design
choices made by the language.</p>
<p>There's even space in this book for a few extended programming examples and
exercises, both of which are very important for a programming book. Some of the
exercises come with solutions in an appendix - a truly impressive information
density for a ~250 page book.</p>
<p>My favorite chapter is <em>Monadic Parsers</em>; parser combinators is a very
interesting topic, and I went through several resources that tried to explain it
in Haskell. The treatment in this book is much better than anything I read
before (it even inspired a <a class="reference external" href="../deciphering-haskells-applicative-and-monadic-parsers/index.html">blog post</a>
to document my understanding).</p>
<p>On the flip side, the last two chapters - on automatically proving programs
correct, as well as deriving correct programs from definitions - were puzzling.
Felt too academic and somewhat out of place in a book teaching a programming
language. I suppose that when you write a book, it's your prerogative to include
some of the research topics you're excited about and pitch them to a more
general audience :-)</p>
<p>It's hard to resist comparing this book to Learn You a Haskell (LYAH), which
is based on the false premise that complete beginners want or need to learn
Haskell (IMHO they don't). I would guess that most folks coming to Haskell have
some programming experience in other languages and are looking to expand their
horizons and get some functional and static typing enlightment. <em>Programming in
Haskell</em> is <em>exactly</em> the book these programmers need to read.</p>
