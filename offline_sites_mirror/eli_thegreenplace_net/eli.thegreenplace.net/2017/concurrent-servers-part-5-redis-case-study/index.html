                <p>This is part 5 in a series of posts on writing concurrent network servers. After
discussing techniques for constructing concurrent servers in parts 1-4, this
time we're going to do a case study of an existing production-quality server -
<a class="reference external" href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>.</p>
<img alt="Redis logo" class="align-center" src="../../images/2017/redis_logo.png" style="width: 320px;" />
<p>Redis is a fascinating project and I've been following it with interest for a
while now. One of the things I admire most about Redis is the clarity of its C
source code. It also happens to be a great example of a high-performance
concurrent in-memory database server, so the opportunity to use it as a case
study for this series was too good to ignore.</p>
<p>Let's see how the ideas discussed in parts 1-4 apply to a real-world
application.</p>

<div class="section" id="event-handling-library">
<h2>Event-handling library</h2>
<p>One of Redis's main claims to fame around the time of its original release in
2009 was its <em>speed</em> - the sheer number of concurrent client connections the
server could handle. It was especially notable that Redis did this all <em>in a
single thread</em>, without any complex locking and synchronization schemes on the
data stored in memory.</p>
<p>This feat was achieved by Redis's own implementation of an event-driven library
which is wrapping the fastest event loop available on a system (<tt class="docutils literal">epoll</tt> for
Linux, <tt class="docutils literal">kqueue</tt> for BSD and so on). This library is called <a class="reference external" href="https://redis.io/topics/internals-rediseventlib">ae</a>. <tt class="docutils literal">ae</tt> makes it possible to
write a fast server as long as none of the internals are blocking, which Redis
goes to great lengths to guarantee <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>What mainly interests us here is <tt class="docutils literal">ae</tt>'s support of <em>file events</em> - registering
callbacks to be invoked when file descriptors (like network sockets) have
something interesting pending. Like <tt class="docutils literal">libuv</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">ae</tt> supports multiple event
loops and - having read parts 3 and 4 in this series - the signature of
<tt class="docutils literal">aeCreateFileEvent</tt> shouldn't be surprising:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">aeCreateFileEvent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">aeEventLoop</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">eventLoop</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">mask</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">                      </span><span class="n">aeFileProc</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">proc</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">clientData</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>It registers a callback (<tt class="docutils literal">proc</tt>) for new file events on <tt class="docutils literal">fd</tt>, with the given
event loop. When using <tt class="docutils literal">epoll</tt>, it will call <tt class="docutils literal">epoll_ctl</tt> to add an event on
the file descriptor (either <tt class="docutils literal">EPOLLIN</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">EPOLLOUT</tt> or both, depending on the
<tt class="docutils literal">mask</tt> parameter). <tt class="docutils literal">ae</tt>'s <tt class="docutils literal">aeProcessEvents</tt> is the &quot;run the event loop and
dispatch callbacks&quot; function, and it calls <tt class="docutils literal">epoll_wait</tt> under the hood.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="handling-client-requests">
<h2>Handling client requests</h2>
<p>Let's trace through the Redis server code to see how <tt class="docutils literal">ae</tt> is used to register
callbacks for client events. <tt class="docutils literal">initServer</tt> starts it by registering a callback
for read events on the socket(s) being listened to, by calling
<tt class="docutils literal">aeCreateFileEvent</tt> with the callback <tt class="docutils literal">acceptTcpHandler</tt>. This callback is
invoked when new client connections are available. It calls <tt class="docutils literal">accept</tt> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a> and
then <tt class="docutils literal">acceptCommonHandler</tt>, which in turn calls <tt class="docutils literal">createClient</tt> to initialize
the data structures required to track a new client connection.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">createClient</tt>'s job is to start listening for data coming in from the client.
It sets the socket to non-blocking mode (a key ingredient in an asynchronous
event loop) and registers another file event callback with <tt class="docutils literal">aeCreateFileEvent</tt>
- for read events - <tt class="docutils literal">readQueryFromClient</tt>. This function will be invoked by
the event loop every time the client sends some data.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">readQueryFromClient</tt> does just what we'd expect - parses the client's command
and acts on it by querying and/or manipulating data and sending a reply back.
Since the client socket is non-blocking, this function has to be able to handle
<tt class="docutils literal">EAGAIN</tt>, as well as partial data; data read from the client is accumulated in
a client-specific buffer, and the full query may be split across multiple
invocations of the callback.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sending-data-back-to-clients">
<h2>Sending data back to clients</h2>
<p>In the previous paragraph I said that <tt class="docutils literal">readQueryFromClient</tt> ends up sending
replies back to clients. This is logically true, because <tt class="docutils literal">readQueryFromClient</tt>
<em>prepares</em> the reply to be sent, but it doesn't actually do the physical sending
- since there's no guarantee the client socket is ready for writing/sending
data. We have to use the event loop machinery for that.</p>
<p>The way Redis does this is by registering a <tt class="docutils literal">beforeSleep</tt> function to be
called every time the event loop is about to go sleeping waiting for sockets to
become available for reading/writing. One of the things <tt class="docutils literal">beforeSleep</tt> does is
call <tt class="docutils literal">handleClientsWithPendingWrites</tt>. This function tries to send all
available replies immediately by calling <tt class="docutils literal">writeToClient</tt>; if some of the
sockets are unavailable, it registers an event-loop callback to invoke
<tt class="docutils literal">sendReplyToClient</tt> when the socket <em>is</em> ready. This can be seen as a kind of
optimization - if the socket is immediately ready for sending (which often is
the case for TCP sockets), there's no need to register the event - just send the
data. Since sockets are non-blocking, this never actually blocks the loop.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-does-redis-roll-its-own-event-library">
<h2>Why does Redis roll its own event library?</h2>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="../concurrent-servers-part-4-libuv/index.html">part 4</a> we've
discussed building asynchronous concurrent servers using <tt class="docutils literal">libuv</tt>. It's
interesting to ponder the fact that Redis doesn't use <tt class="docutils literal">libuv</tt>, or any similar
event library, and instead implements its own - <tt class="docutils literal">ae</tt>, including wrappers for
<tt class="docutils literal">epoll</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">kqueue</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">select</tt>. In fact, antirez (Redis's creator)
answered precisely this question <a class="reference external" href="http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/redis-win32-msft-patch.html">in a blog post in 2011</a>. The gist of
his answer: <tt class="docutils literal">ae</tt> is ~770 lines of code he intimately understands; <tt class="docutils literal">libuv</tt> is
huge, without providing additional functionality Redis needs.</p>
<p>Today, <tt class="docutils literal">ae</tt> has grown to ~1300 lines, which is still trivial compared to
<tt class="docutils literal">libuv</tt>'s 26K (this is <em>without</em> Windows, test, samples, docs). <tt class="docutils literal">libuv</tt> is a
far more general library, which makes it more complex and more difficult to
adapt to the particular needs of another project; <tt class="docutils literal">ae</tt>, on the other hand, was
designed for Redis, co-evolved with Redis and contains only what Redis needs.</p>
<p>This is another great example of the dependencies in software projects formula I
mentioned <a class="reference external" href="../benefits-of-dependencies-in-software-projects-as-a-function-of-effort/index.html">in a post earlier this year</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
The benefit of dependencies is inversely proportional to the amount of
effort spent on a software project.</blockquote>
<p>antirez referred to this, to some extent, in his post. He mentioned that
dependencies that provide a lot of added value (&quot;foundational&quot; dependencies in
my post) make more sense (<tt class="docutils literal">jemalloc</tt> and Lua are his examples) than
dependencies like <tt class="docutils literal">libuv</tt>, whose functionality is fairly easy to implement for
the particular needs of Redis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multi-threading-in-redis">
<h2>Multi-threading in Redis</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://antirez.com/news/93">For the vast majority of its history</a>, Redis has
been a purely single-threaded affair. Some people find this surprising, but it
makes total sense with a bit of thought. Redis is inherently network-bound - as
long as the database size is reasonable, for any given client request, much more
time is spent waiting on the network than inside Redis's data structures.</p>
<p>These days, however, things are not quite that simple. There are several new
capabilities in Redis that use threads:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>&quot;Lazy&quot; <a class="reference external" href="http://antirez.com/news/93">freeing of memory</a>.</li>
<li>Writing a <a class="reference external" href="https://redis.io/topics/persistence">persistence journal</a> with
<tt class="docutils literal">fsync</tt> calls in a background thread.</li>
<li>Running user-defined modules that need to perform a long-running operation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first two features, Redis uses its own simple <tt class="docutils literal">bio</tt> library (the
acronym stands for &quot;Background I/O&quot;). The library is hard-coded for Redis's
needs and can't be used outside it - it runs a pre-set number of threads, one
per background job type Redis needs.</p>
<p>For the third feature, <a class="reference external" href="https://redis.io/topics/modules-intro">Redis modules</a>
could define new Redis commands, and thus are held to the same standards as
regular Redis commands, including not blocking the main thread. If a custom
Redis command defined in a module wants to perform a long-running operation, it
has to spin up a thread to run it in the background.
<tt class="docutils literal">src/modules/helloblock.c</tt> in the Redis tree provides an example.</p>
<p>With these features, Redis combines an event loop with threading to get both
speed in the common case and flexibility in the general case, similarly to the
work queue discussion in <a class="reference external" href="../concurrent-servers-part-4-libuv/index.html">part 4</a> of this
series.</p>
