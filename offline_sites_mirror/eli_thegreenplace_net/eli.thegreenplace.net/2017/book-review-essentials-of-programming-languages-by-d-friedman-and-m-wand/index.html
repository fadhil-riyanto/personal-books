                <p>[Note: this review is about the 3rd edition of the book]</p>
<p>This book is a detailed overview of some fundamental ideas in the design of
programming languages. It teaches by presenting toy languages that demonstrate
these ideas, with a full interpreter for every language (implemented in
Scheme). After discussing some basic concepts like scoping, it gets into the
ways state can exist in a language; then a whole chapter deals with
continuation-passing style. This chapter also describes exceptions, coroutines
and threads (all implemented with continuations). Other chapters discuss module
systems and object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>The book was created as a companion/summary of a university course. When read
stand-alone, it's not very easy to get through due to the huge number of
concepts presented and discussed in fairly limited space (~350 pages). IMHO
the authors could spend more time explaining and demonstrating the concepts
before jumping into implementation - but maybe as a companion to lectures it's
not really necessary. This is definitely something to take into account if
you're just reading the book; it's not for beginners.</p>
<p>I went through this book in a fairly detailed way (not quite like my <a class="reference external" href="../../2008/04/18/sicp-conclusion.html">SICP
journey</a>, but not
very far from it). It took me several months of spending a couple of hours a
week on it, and I wrote almost 10,000 lines of Clojure code implementing most of
the interpreters (and some of the exercises) described in it. Clojure was a good
choice. It's sufficiently similar to Scheme that the concepts translate without
too much trouble; on the other hand, it <em>is</em> a different language so mindless
copy-pasting doesn't work. I ran out of steam somewhere in the middle of the
penultimate chapter (on Modules) and stopped implementing, since the concepts
of Modules and OOP seemed more familiar and less interesting.</p>
<p>My favorite part was, no doubt, the chapter on continuations. It helped me
understand concepts like <a class="reference external" href="../on-recursion-continuations-and-trampolines/index.html">CPS and trampolines</a>
to a deeper extent than ever before. For this, I'm forever thankful to the
authors.</p>
<p>It's hard to say how beneficial a lighter skimming of this book can be. Without
implementing the interpreters, the discussion is fairly weak. Implementing them
takes time and code in advanced chapters builds on top of more code in earlier
chapters.</p>
