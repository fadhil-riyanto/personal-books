                </div>
                <p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">reStructuredText</a> are two markup languages with
plain text formatting syntax designed for easy input with any text editor. Each
has a whole host of tools that can convert marked up text to publishing formats
like HTML or PDF.</p>
<p>Software developers these days have to be familiar with such markup languages
because they serve as the basis for many documentation systems. In this post I
want to examine the tradeoffs between Markdown and reStructuredText from the
point of view of a programmer.</p>
<div class="section" id="where-markdown-shines">
<h2>Where Markdown shines</h2>
<p>The history of markup languages for describing complex document structure with
rich formatting through textual input is long and illustrious, dating back at
least to the early 1970s with <em>troff</em> and later on TeX. In the 1990s these
formats escaped the specialized dominion of mathematicians and programmers, as a
multitude of people went online and wanted to interact through mediums like
forums. This led to the birth of markup languages like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode">BBCode</a> in 1998.</p>
<p>Markdown came a bit later, in 2004, and really pushed the concept over the brink
of ubiquitousness. Was it because of the relative fame of its inventors (John
Gruber and Aaron Swartz)? Or maybe it was just a good idea in the right place
at the right time, coupled with a catchy name? It's hard to say now, but one
thing is certain - these days Markdown the big gorilla in any discussion of
textual markup languages. It's likely to be the first thing on one's mind when
thinking of a technology to use for, say, documentation or textual entry into
some program.</p>
<img alt="Markdown logo" class="align-center" src="../../images/2017/markdown-logo-crop.png" />
<p>So the best thing about Markdown is, IMHO, its popularity. It's a natural choice
since it's so familiar, and one can find tools in almost any conceivable
programming language and environment for parsing and munging it. Just by virtue
of being the default markup language for StackOverflow, Reddit and GitHub,
Markdown is probably well familiar to most developers these days.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-rest-shines">
<h2>Where reST shines</h2>
<p>reStructuredText's initial release dates back to 2002, actually predating
Markdown. The problem is, it lived in relative obscurity for most of its life,
confined to some parts of the Python community. The core Python documentation
has been written in reST for quite a while, but only after the release of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/">Sphinx</a> has it seen serious uptake
outside. These days reST is taken more seriously - GitHub supports it for pages
and wikis, and some major projects use it by default for their documentation -
including the Linux kernel, OpenCV and LLVM/Clang.</p>
<p>To me, reST stands out against Markdown it three main aspects, which I'll cover
in detail:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It's more fully-featured.</li>
<li>It's much more standardized and uniform.</li>
<li>It has built-in support for extensions.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="more-features">
<h3>More features</h3>
<p>reST comes with more built-in features for writing more complex documents. Some
examples I personally use the most: footnotes, tables, citations, tables of
contents. There is no standard way of doing these in Markdown, which is a
problem because these and other features are important for implementing complete
documentation systems. Sure, these can be added as extensions; but Markdown
doesn't have a standard extension mechanism, which means that every system
develops its own non-standard way of doing things. Which leads me to...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="more-standardized-and-uniform">
<h3>More standardized and uniform</h3>
<p>The original Markdown syntax was defined de-facto by its initial implementation;
there was no real standard to speak of, and the built-in assumptions and bugs of
the initial implementation became unoffically baked in. There's a long and
fascinating background story about the standardization attempt of Markdown led
by Jeff Attwood (for the sake of StackOverflow); you can easily google for it.</p>
<p>I'll just point to the <a class="reference external" href="http://spec.commonmark.org/0.27/">CommonMark spec</a>,
which is the result of this attempt. It has a section named &quot;Why is a spec
needed&quot; listing some of the underspecified aspects of Markdown; it's worth
reading.</p>
<p>Due to this, what ends up happening is that there's no single Markdown. There is
a multitude of related markup languages with a common core, some more conformant
than others. When features are missing, sites/tools usually roll on some custom
extension which isn't coordinated with other sites/tools.</p>
<p>reST, on the contrary, has a fairly <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html">comprehensive spec</a> and a
single canonical implementation that is still being actively developed - the
<a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">docutils project</a>. Sure, there are
alternative implementations (such as a JS one for client-side rendering), but
these at least can follow the written-down spec. Therefore, there's really just
one reST, and the source you write is likely to work in multiple systems.</p>
<img alt="A class diagram for docutils parser" class="align-center" src="../../images/2017/rest-class-diagram.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="built-in-support-for-extensions">
<h3>Built-in support for extensions</h3>
<p>As discussed before, Markdown implementations are all over the place when it
comes to features beyond the commonly-agreed-upon core. reST is very different.
Extension is a core design principle, and both custom roles (for inline
elements) and directives (for block elements) can be easily added. It's
therefore straightforward to add extensions for commonly-needed stuff like
syntax-highlighted code blocks, math equations for Latex rendering and so on.</p>
<p>With Markdown, to add an extension one has to <em>modify the parser</em>, which makes
every Markdown implementation out there an island of its own. In reST, adding an
extension is just an API call in <tt class="docutils literal">docutils</tt>. With this in hand, documentation
systems like Sphinx and static website generators like Pelican heavily customize
their reST input language while using the original <tt class="docutils literal">docutils</tt> parser.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, which one to choose? I'd say this depends on the use case. For fully-fledged
documentation of a large (or small) software project, I'd definitely go with
reST, most likely using Sphinx. I hope this post managed to convey why reST is a
better choice for this scenario.</p>
<p>For a simple markup system use in things like forum comments, or marking up chat
messages, the decision is trickier. Markdown is a good choice because more users
would be familiar with it. On the other hand, if you're already using reST for
something else, consistency is important too.</p>
