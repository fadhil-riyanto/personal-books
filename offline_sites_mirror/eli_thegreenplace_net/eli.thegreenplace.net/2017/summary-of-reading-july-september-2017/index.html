                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;A Mind for Numbers&quot; by Barbara Oakley - (A companion book to the MOOC
&quot;Learning how to learn&quot;). A mixture of some trivial effective learning tips
and general feely-goody advice. I suppose this book could be useful for
high-school students, or maybe college students in the first semesters. Above
that level of experience I don't think it's worth the time.</li>
<li>&quot;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&quot; by Michael C. Feathers -
<a class="reference external" href="../book-review-working-effectively-with-legacy-code-by-michael-c-feathers/index.html">full review</a>.</li>
<li>&quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined&quot; by Steven
Pinker - a very thorough study of the steady decline in violence in the last
few centuries (yes, including the world wars of the 20th). Interesting and
convincing, but as is typical for Pinker, a bit too verbose. I think it would
be a much better book if it dropped a bunch of marginally relevant information
Pinker finds hard to stop talking about (brain structure, various social
behavior studies, etc.) and as a result slimmed down from its 800+ dense pages
to something like half that size. If you've never read any other books by
Pinker or other authors who write on these subjects, though, you may found a
larger portion of the book interesting. YMMV but recommended overall.</li>
<li>&quot;The Tao Is Silent&quot; by Raymond M. Smullyan - Disguised as an introduction to
Taoism, this is a scattered overview of the author's philosophy of life;
Taoism is a prominent part of it, but there's no real attempt made to explain
it. Unfortunately, the book's writing style is of a kind I dislike - too much
cleverness, going in circles and jumping to seemingly unrelated topics. It did
give me a taste to learn more about Taoism, but I'll have to look elsewhere
for that.</li>
<li>&quot;Beneath a Scarlet Sky&quot; by Mark Sullivan - a true-story novel about the
Italian resistance during the final stages of WWII, focusing on a 18-year old
protagonist and his role in helping smuggle Jews across the Alps and spying on
a high-rank Nazi general while being his personal driver. Not the best
writing, but an engaging read regardless. Very interesting story about a part
of the war I haven't heard much before.</li>
<li>&quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot; by Benjamin Hoff - An unusual approach to teaching
philosophy; the author attempts to explain some of the basics of Taoism by
setting Winnie the Pooh as an example. It feels a forced at times and a bit
too hippie for me (all this science is ruining the earth, let's stop doing it,
stories of people living to age 260, etc.), but overall an enjoyable little
book. It's certainly a vastly better introduction to Taoism than Smullyan's
nonsense. Very light, entertaining quick read.</li>
<li>&quot;The Complete Tales of Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; by A.A. Milne - No my usual
fare :) I read tons of children's books with my kids but don't really post
reviews. Pooh is different because it's fairly long (comparable to adult
books) and I also feel it really caters for older audiences. I was inspired to
finally read it cover-to-cover after &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot;, being curious whether
I can spot the Taoist stuff without annotation. I couldn't, and it seems like
Benjamin Hoff extracted every bit of teachable Pooh moment into &quot;The Tao of
Pooh&quot;. I was surprised by the number of stories I haven't heard before - it
seems that all modern depictions of Pooh focus on 3-4 of the most popular
stories and leave all the rest out. Overall it's a great book as the
characters all represent different human traits that are pretty easy to
understand and follow.</li>
<li>&quot;The Way of Zen&quot; by Alan W. Watts - An very good introduction to Taoism and
Zen Buddhism, inasmuch as these topics can be described in book form. I
particularly liked the author's explanation of how Westerners may perceive the
world a bit differently from the cultures where Zen originated, due to
fundamental differences in language, and how this can make spiritual topics
more difficult to understand - one of the best examples of the Sapir Whorf
hypothesis I read anywhere.</li>
<li>&quot;The Epigenetics Revolution&quot; by Nessa Carey - A very interesting popular
account of the recent advances in epigenetic research, which is anything
pertaining to varying expression of genes in different cells and in the same
cells throughout cellular development. Fairly well written, though
occasionally it's clear the author is a biology PhD who assumes a bit too much
about the readers' knowledge - I had to read parts of the book twice to
understand them better. Epigenetics is an exciting field that expands our
knowledge beyond the basic understanding of what genes are, and it's really
cool to see how rapidly this field is advancing in the last 10-15 years.</li>
<li>&quot;Learn You a Haskell for Great Good&quot; by Miran Lipovaca - a Haskell book
for beginners. Feels more like a collection of introductory blog posts than a
cohesive book; can serve as a quick, light introduction to Haskell but not
much more than that. Haskell has one of the steepest learning curves in modern
languages, and this book's approach is not helpful. It rarely goes deep into
the <em>why</em> of things, mostly a sequence of <em>how</em>, uses silly childish examples
instead of real, useful ones, and has no exercises.</li>
<li>&quot;NurtureShock: New Thinking about Children&quot; by Po Bronson and Ashley
Merryman - presents some interesting new research about child development,
with varying topics from sibling rivalry to academic success. One of the key
messages is that children's brains are inherently different from adults (until
they fully develop), and hence strategies that make sense for developing
adults don't necessarily make sense for children. Interestingly, it seems that
some of the topics the book discusses were already implemented in mainstream
education (for example praising for effort and not for intelligence). On the
down side I found the last third or so of the book less interesting;
especially the research on speech development in babies seems very
inconclusive and page-fill-ery.</li>
<li>&quot;Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea&quot; by Barbara Demick - an
awesome documentary account of the life in North Korea in the 1990s and early
2000s, recounted from interviews with North Korean defectors to South Korea.
The books is written as a series of intertwined personal stories of 6 North
Koreans about their life in the reclusive country. The result is an extremely
well drawn portrait of North Korea - very interesting book, I learned a lot.</li>
<li>&quot;Naked Statistics&quot; by Charles Wheelan - A simplified introduction to
statistics, peppered with many anecdotes and real-life examples of statistical
studies. Nice book, but far from the greatness of &quot;Naked Economics&quot; by the
same author. Somehow I feel that far less material has been covered here,
perhaps because the author tried to go deeper in some topics. For folks not
familiar with statistics at all, this book may be more insightful and
enjoyable.</li>
<li>&quot;El Prisionero del Cielo&quot; by Carlos Ruiz Zafón (read in Spanish) - a
continuation of La Sombra del Viento and Juego del ángel. Similar tone, style
and beautiful writing, but somewhat short on content IMHO. There's just not
much happening in this book except the story of Fermin's incarceration.</li>
<li>&quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; by Richard Russo - a follow-up on &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;,
happening about a decade later. Mostly the same characters, and a very similar
vibe. Amazing writing, as usual, from Russo.</li>
