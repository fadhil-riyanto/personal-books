                <p>I've just finished going through the Machine Learning course on Coursera, and
this is a brief review.</p>
<p>The scope of the course is quite broad, covering a lot of topics from both
supervised and unsupervised machine learning. &quot;Practical advice&quot; parts are
sprinkled throughout the lectures and are extremely useful - how to evaluate
your algorithm, how to know what to focus on, practical tips for improving speed
and accuracy, etc.</p>
<p>Machine Learning is one of the oldest courses on Coursera, and is extremely
polished by now. In the lectures, Andrew Ng foresees the questions that may
arise and answers them beforehead. The programming excercises are very well
organized with very little detail left to chance. They're quite sizable too. I
added extra work to myself by using Python instead of Octave (if you use Octave
or Matlab a lot gets set up for you by the code provided with the assignment),
but that's probably not the bulk of the code. ~2200 lines of dense numerical
code (in throwaway homework mode - barely any comments and few unit tests) is
quite a lot.</p>
<p>One thing I liked somewhat less is the lack of mathematical depth. I realize the
reason for this is the relatively low barrier of entry they want to set for the
course, I'm sure that Stanford students taking the real course are expected to
know some linear algebra and probability and the formulae can be developed,
rather than just presented as an act of god. This was especially noticeable in
the lecture on PCA, where Prof Ng just dropped the eigenvector approach, and
even went so far as to provide the exact Octave function to call, without much
mathematical background or reasoning. Indeed, it is quite possible to implement
the PCA part of the programming exercises without really understanding how PCA
works.</p>
<p>Which brings me to a related topic. The course is way too easy to provide a
meaningful certificate. The review quizzes are trivial and require very little
thought. The programming exercises, while demanding in terms of invested time,
aren't going deep either, and don't deviate from the lecture materials - you
basically follow very detailed instructions and transcribe formulae into code.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed the course, and I would highly recommend it to anyone
interested in getting into machine learning (or, by its new-age name, <em>big
data</em>).</p>
<p>Finally, an interesting observation I had while working through the programming
assignments in Python (using Numpy, Scipy and Scikit-learn). Domain specific
languages (like Matlab/Octave for general numerics and R for statistics) are
often hailed as eye-openers because they come equipped with some facilities
tailored at scientific programming (like a convenient notation for defining
constant matrices), but I don't think this is the right approach. Writing Python
with Numpy et. al, some basic things may take a bit more keystrokes to achieve,
but eventually you end up with very similar code. Moreover, it's all the same
Fortran-written LINPACK running under the hood anyways, so performance is the
same.</p>
<p>However, expressing a constant matrix in the most concise way possible is not
the end of the story when writing a machine learning system. It's nice to have
an actual programming language in your hands, with all that entails - community,
libraries, etc. It was curious to notice the impact of this in the spam
classification assignment. Tons of textual preprocessing for which Octave is not
very well suitable. Need to implement some NLP algorithms, for which Octave has
no libraries, etc. In Python it was all a breeze, of course, including importing
NLTK to take care of any NLP needs.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that Python is the best tool for every job. But for exploratory
scientific programming, it seems like the strongest option out there. Numpy and
its kin are very mature, fast and well-supported. Plotting with matplotlib is
great (and I heard that the legendary ggplot from R now has Python bindings as
well). And when you need to step outside the narrow domain of computations, you
have the full programming language with all its support structure at your
command.</p>
