                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;American Rust&quot; by Philipp Meyer - set out in a formerly prosperous area of
Pennsylvania that went through an economic collapse due to the demise of the
local steel industry. The story is very engaging, and somewhat morally
confusing - it's hard to decide on whose side to be. Overall, a pretty good
read, though the ending could be better.</li>
<li>&quot;The Paradox of Choice: Why more is less&quot; by Barry Schwartz - one of the most
useless books I read recently. Though it was obvious from very early on that
this book is going to be disappointing, I bravely plowed through, finally
giving up at around 65%. Seriously, I don't need a whole book to tell me how
we have many choices in modern life, and how it can be detrimental. Not sure
what I was looking for when I set out to read it, really; mental note - be
more careful in the future. I suppose for some people this book can be an eye
opener (divert them from their foul ways), but not being one to succumb to a
plenitude of options myself, I just don't see the point.</li>
<li>&quot;The Emperor of all Maladies: A Biography of Cancer&quot; by Siddhartha Mukherjee -
a very well written book (Pulitzer prizes don't get handed out for nothing),
but a very troubling one at the same time. The long chapters about leukemia in
children will make any parent squirm, and the general feeling of hopelessness
drags throughout this long book. Yes, the final couple of chapters are
hopeful, but the vast majority of the book leaves a stronger impression. I
wouldn't call the book perfect - some parts (like the legal battles
surrounding smoking) could be made much shorter, and I wish some other parts
(like the biology of the cancer cell and recent research in general) could be
longer. Overall, however, it's a great read.</li>
<li>&quot;The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, Vol I&quot; by Bertrand Russell - Russell
was one of the most brilliant minds of the early 20th century, with large
contributions to mathematics, philosophy and politics (for some reason, there
are fewer such polymaths lately - perhaps because the areas of knowledge
became too specialized). This book is the first volume of 3 in his
autobiography, from childhood to age ~40 (he lived to 97, so there's plenty
more to tell). It's a surprisingly readable and enjoyable book in most parts.
I found the letters to be a bit tiresome, especially given that many are
addressed <em>to</em> Russell and weren't written by him.</li>
<li>&quot;John von Neumann and the Origins of Modern Computing&quot; by William Aspray - a
biography of John von Neumann's various contributions to early computing. The
man this book describes was extremely impressive - a truly inspiring breadth
and depth of knowledge. The book itself is somewhat dry though, somewhat
academic with many hundreds of detailed notes and references, and very
matter-of-factual presentation. Reads a bit like a long encyclopedia entry.</li>
<li>&quot;The Goldfinch&quot; by Donna Tartt - An exceptionally well-written and captivating
book. It's obvious that the author made a huge investment in research - there
are tons of small but interesting details sprinkled all over. I'm not sure I
like the ending, but overall the book is excellent.</li>
<li>&quot;Mastery&quot; by George Leonard - in the preface, the author mentions that he
wrote this book after being asked by readers for more information following a
magazine article he wrote earlier on the same topic. This shows :) Though the
book is fairly short (less than 200 pages in a small format), its essence
could really be summarized in just a few pages. This is the first part of the
book. The rest feels like filler. That said, the essence is well worth the
read. The main thesis is that on the path to mastery (e.g. any learning or
development journey) what matters is the path itself, not the end goal. This
lesson pops up in various guises in self-help materials, but Leonard really
has a nice way to describe it and teach it, so I'd say the book is
recommended. If you also happen to be an auto-didactic introvert who enjoyed
Csikszentmihalyi's &quot;Flow&quot;, then this book is a must-have complement.</li>
<li>&quot;Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking&quot; by
Susan Cain (audiobook) - the author sets on a quest to define the differences
between introverts and extroverts, and most importantly to help introverts
self-validate about their place in life and society. I think this book could
be quite important to introvert persons who aren't feeling good about their
social skills and are in a defining period of their lives (say high-school to
early years of career). For older individuals, the most interesting insights
will be about how to properly raise children who are introverts. It's not a
bad book in general, but it has some suboptimal properties. For example,
trying to cleanly divide the world into two personality types is a stretch,
and the gross generalizations that result from this are unavoidable. It also
feels rather unscientific in places. And too much bashing of extroverts, IMHO.</li>
<li>&quot;The Son&quot; by Philipp Meyer - a very well-written saga about a Texan family,
spread over half of the 19th century and most of the 20th. Tells the story
from the POV of three different family members - the original patriarch, his
son, and his grand-granddaughter. The writing is excellent, though I dislike
explicit tricks that make it hard to put a book down (intersperse several plot
lines and always end each segment with something that leaves you in suspense).
What I found most interesting is the description of life among the Comanches;
it's either all imagined or the author did some serious research (I certainly
hope for the latter). The ending of the book is kind-of unexpected and
anti-climatic, but then again, it also makes sense, in a way.</li>
<li>&quot;Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning&quot; by P. Brown, H. Roediger
and M. McDaniel (audiobook) - the authors present several techniques for more
effective learning. The first half (or so) of the book is very interesting and
enjoyable - the efficacy of testing as opposed to repeated reading, the
advantages of forcing recall and spaced repetition - it all makes a lot of
sense and represents the same central theme from different angles. The second
part of the book is less useful, IMHO, and feels like filler.</li>
<li>&quot;A Student's Guide to Vectors and Tensors&quot; by Daniel Fleisch - a short
book that attempts to provide an introduction to the mathematics and uses of
vectors and tensors. I mainly picked it up for the latter. While the book is
well written in general and does a fairly good job explaining the material,
IMHO the division of effort between vectors and tensors is wrong. Vectors are
a much more basic and familiar concept, and much easier to relate to the
physical world. Hence, spending significantly more time on vectors and
providing more examples isn't the best choice here. If this is someone's first
exposure to <em>vectors</em>, he's unlikely to get tensors on a first reading of this
book. And for someone already familiar with vectors and looking for more
information on tensors, the first part of the book is almost useless. I was
also disappointed by the lack of rigor - important concepts are presented
without any proof or motivation. The exercises do a good job of complementing
the material - the online solution manual is awesome, though I felt the
exercises are a bit on the easy side.</li>
