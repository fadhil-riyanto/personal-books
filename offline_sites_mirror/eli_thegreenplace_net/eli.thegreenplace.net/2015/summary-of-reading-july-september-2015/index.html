                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;The Whole-Brain Child&quot; by Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson - one of
those books that smears a handful of good ideas over two hundred pages. The
&quot;scientific&quot; angle the authors try to take is, IMHO somewhat light on real
hard science - most of it is just in the realm of naturally intuitive ideas
and pop-culture stereotypes (the whole right-brain vs. left-brain issue, for
example). That said, even though most of the book is Tony Robbins-style
general feel-good advice, there <em>are</em> a few interesting suggestions in it that
are worth reading the book for.</li>
<li>&quot;The Fabric of the Cosmos&quot; by Brian Greene - an information packed whirlwind
through modern physics. On the textbook-to-pop science line, this books lays
much farther ahead from pop science than other similar books, such as those by
Simon Singh, by delving much deeper into the details. I particularly enjoyed
Greene's explanation of special relativity and the second law of
thermodynamics. OTOH, the explanation of entanglement and Bell's theorem could
be a bit better (though I'll admit I don't know if that's possible without
getting into real math). On the average the book is very good, though. I
enjoyed the last part of the book somewhat less - as soon as things get into
string theory and even stranger theories (branes, holograms, etc) they become
almost impossible to understand intuitively, because they don't represent
anything human intuition can grasp. Greene admits that these theories are
usually studied through their mathematical equations because none of their
physics is obvious (they're not even experimentally tested yet).</li>
<li>&quot;Particle Physics for Non-Physicists&quot; by Steven Pollock (audio course) - a
laymen overview of particle physics, focusing on the history of discovering
the particle zoo that currently comprises the standard model. This is somewhat
more advanced than the other &quot;introductory&quot; modern physics courses I've heard
so far, and as such I also feel it approaches the limit of what can be
effectively taught in such a course for laymen. The topic of particle physics
is super complex, and explaining it without extensive math is challenging. In
an audio setting, explaining it without using <em>any</em> visual aids like diagrams
and drawings is even more challenging. So don't expect to learn much beyond a
very trivial glimpse of the subject from here. That said, the course is well
put and the lecturer is good, so it's not a bad use of one's time. It
definitely does a decent job of putting all the possible particles in some
order and explain their main characteristics and how (and why) they were
discovered.</li>
<li>&quot;The Martian&quot; by Andy Weir - what a great book! A Mars exploration mission
goes wrong and an astronaut is left stranded on the desolate red planet for
many months. Science fiction at its best, IMHO, is one that's at least
somewhat plausible. It's what really incites imagination - things that could
actually happen in the not-too-far future. I think this book is particularly
fun for engineers who like to do back-of-the-envelope computations and get
excited by duct-tape-and-zipties creative solutions to problems (a-la
MacGyver). One of my favorite childhood books was <a class="reference external" href="../../2005/03/25/book-review-mysterious-island-by-jules-verne.html">The Mysterious Island</a>
by Jules Verne. &quot;The Martian&quot; is finally something to match it, but
transported onto a much more modern setting.</li>
<li>&quot;Einstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution&quot; by Richard Wolfson
(audio course) - a tour through modern physics for non-scientists. As is usual
with such books/courses, the simpler topics in the beginning get a thorough
treatment, while the more complex topics later on get mostly skimmed. That
said, one can't expect to get a good understanding of all of modern physics
from a single course (truly, a whole physics degree is needed for that).
Overall, I liked the course - prof. Wolfson is pretty good at explaining
things, and I found his explanation of special relativity interesting and easy
to follow. It's a shame the last few lectures are in sprint-mode, covering
important topics like particle physics only on a very superficial
story-telling level. I'd gladly hear more in-depth lectures from prof. Wolfson
on these topics.</li>
<li>&quot;Coding the Matrix - Linear Algebra through Computer Science applications&quot;
by Philip N. Klein - an introduction to linear algebra with emphasis on
implementing its fundamental algorithms (in Python). This book is a companion
to a Coursera course by the same author. Even though it's an
application-oriented book, it doesn't give up rigor and most of the
propositions are proven. Also, the computation angle is nice and unusual for a
math textbook. However, as a standalone book (I didn't take the course) it's
lacking, IMHO. I found it poorly organized and overly verbose. Also, the
formatting is terrible - the book seems to be some sort of self-printing, it's
basically A4 pages glued together (too tall to fit on my bookshelf!). The
diagrams are often unintelligible, and code samples sometimes run off their
boxes. The author's over-use of list comprehensions in Python doesn't help in
this aspect :-) This being the first edition and the author's maintaining a
large errata, I believe many of these problems will be fixed in future
editions. To conclude, while the book's practical aspect makes it an
interesting addition to one's bookshelf, I wouldn't recommend it for
self-study.</li>
<li>&quot;What is Relativity&quot; by Jeffrey Bennett - A layman's explanation of the
theory of relativity, split about half-half between special and general
relativity. While the book isn't bad, I didn't find it particularly great
either. Some parts of the explanation on special relativity are lacking (for
example, length contraction if pretty badly explained), and the general
relativity part is too handwavy. I realize it's not easy to explain GR without
diving into the heavy math involved, but I expected more.</li>
