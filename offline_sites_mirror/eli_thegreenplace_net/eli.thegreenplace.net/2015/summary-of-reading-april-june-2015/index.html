                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;Introduction to Linear Algebra&quot; by Gilbert Strang - This book is the lecture
notes for the popular MIT OCW 18.06 course on Linear Algebra by the author.
Note that I say &quot;lecture notes&quot;, which is a better way to describe this book
than &quot;a textbook&quot;. It follows the lectures very closely, and the writing is
the same conversational style Prof. Strang uses in his lectures. The book (and
lectures) cover basic linear algebra really well and provide a useful glimpse
into multiple cool applications of the math studied. On the flip side, the
book could be more rigorous - Prof. Strang clearly doesn't believe in the
usefulness of proofs and rigor in this first introduction to the subject, and
relies on example and intuition. While there's no doubt that he's a gifted
teacher, some amount of proving would be a good supplement.</li>
<li>&quot;Biology: The Science of Life&quot; by Stephen Novicki (audio course) - My interest
in biology has mainly circled around genetics and evolution, so I wanted to
expand my horizons a bit. This is a general &quot;introduction to biology&quot; course
that encompasses a much broader view of the subject. Sure, there's a bunch of
genetics in it, but also a lot of stuff about the structure of cells and
organisms, as well as whole ecosystems and populations. This is also the
longest course/audiobook I've head to date (36 hours).</li>
<li>&quot;How To Prove It&quot; by Daniel Velleman -
<a class="reference external" href="../book-review-how-to-prove-it-by-daniel-velleman/index.html">link to full review</a>.</li>
<li>&quot;The Four Pillars of Investing&quot; by William J. Bernstein - Somewhat similar
to &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot; - trashing stock picking, financial
advisors, brokers and the financial press, recommending diversified market
investment (ETFs, market indexing funds, etc). The first part of the book is a
pretty good analysis of risk vs. return, both historically and conceptually.
Another thing I liked is the analysis of investment strategies based on
tax-protected (IRAs) or taxable accounts. For example, rebalancing a portfolio
makes sense for tax-protected accounts, but not necessarily for taxables
because of the capital gains taxes incurred. Conversely it's curious that the
author (having written the book shortly after the dot-com bubble crash) is
bearish on the stock market in the foreseeable future, something that didn't
materialize (with the strong bull market after the 2008 crash). All in all a
very good read on investing - there's certainly some depth to the book, so it
may be worthwhile to revisit it in the future.</li>
<li>&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; by Robert Heinlein - Very nice science fiction about
a mobile infantry fighter in a futuristic interstellar setting.</li>
<li>&quot;1-2-3 Magic: Effective Discipline for Children 2â€“12&quot; by Thomas W. Phelan -
I very rarely read parenting books, but this one had such stellar reviews that
I decided to try. Besides, I've noticed other parents &quot;counting&quot; their kids
and was curious what it's all about. I wasn't disappointed - the book is
excellent. Not only the main thesis - which is the why and how of counting,
but also some &quot;secondary&quot; chapters on developing healthy relations with your
children, are great. Just the chapter that talks about listening skills and
overparenting is worth reading the book for, in my opinion, in addition to all
the other great material. One small criticism is that the handling of &quot;start&quot;
behaviors, though addressed in depth, felt somewhat weak compared to the other
parts. But it may be because there's just no good solution, I'm not sure.</li>
<li>&quot;The Deadline: A Novel About Project Management&quot; by Tom DeMarco - an
unusual book - hybrid between a weird pseudo-scifi novel and a &quot;best
guidelines for project management&quot; book. There are some good ideas w.r.t.
project management here, but also some weird ones. The preaching is very
waterfall-oriented - meticulous collection of requirements, followed by very
detailed design, followed by a very short period of coding. Leaving only 1/6th
of the duration of the project for coding, because the design is so spotless?
That's kinda weird. Getting rid of code inspections/reviews because, again,
the design is perfect? You've got to be kidding me. Maybe this part of the
book is a joke, who knows. Also, the super-detailed models they build to very
accurately describe the project and all kinds of processes involved in
developing it... Perhaps this would work for some very boilerplate projects,
but I don't see its general applicability. This criticism notwithstanding,
overall the book is pretty funny and not a bad way to teach some interesting
lessons.</li>
