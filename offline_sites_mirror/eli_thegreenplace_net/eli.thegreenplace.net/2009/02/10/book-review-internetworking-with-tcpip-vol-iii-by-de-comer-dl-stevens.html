Full book name: "Internetworking with TCP/IP, Volume III - Client-server
programming and applications, Windows Sockets Version"
      </p><p>

The TCP/IP stack runs the internet and is certainly the most popular networking
technology in the computing world these days. Networked and distributed code
becomes more and more important, especially with the recent trend of
distributing programs over several processors and computers to achieve higher
computation speeds (well, the trend is not exactly recent, but after the
single-code speed rise has slowed down significantly, multi-core paradigms at
once became much more important).
      </p><p>

This book is a very practical introduction to distributed and networked
programming, exploring the most popular programming paradigm for such code -
client-server architectures. It introduces the basic concepts (sockets,
threading, etc.) nicely, and then goes on to present various strategies of
client and server design, and algorithms that are useful for coding such
programs. Iterative servers, threaded servers, multi-process servers are all
covered here, and the basic tradeoffs between them are well presented. Both TCP
servers and UDP servers are presented, and the authors explain when it's best to
use each, with several examples.
      </p><p>

The book contains quite a lot of code with sample programs for the Windows
platform (but since the socket API is basically the same everywhere, the code is
almost universal). In the end, several real-world programs are presented (the
RPC protocol, NFS, TELNET) with complete code listings for implementing selected
functions. 
      </p><p>

Even though I was somewhat familiar with these topics from before, I learned
some interesting things from this book. It's not overly formal and is very easy
to read, covering the topics in a very methodical and complete manner. I liked
how the tradeoffs between various approaches are presented and explored, and
examples given of each approach. If you're doing any serious networked
programming, being familiar with the topics presented in this book is important.
