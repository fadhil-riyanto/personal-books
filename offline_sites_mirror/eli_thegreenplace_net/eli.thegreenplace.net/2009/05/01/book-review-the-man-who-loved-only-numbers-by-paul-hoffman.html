<p>This is a biography of Paul Erdős - the 20th century Jewish Hungarian
mathematician famous for his work in combinatorics, graph theory and
probability. Erdős is the second most prolific publisher of scientific papers in
history, after Leonhard Euler himself, having written a whopping 1475
mathematical articles in his lifetime with 511 different collaborators.

</p><p>
He was certainly a unique and eccentric character, a living example of how weird
some genial mathematicians can get. Paul Hoffman does a good job of describing
central episodes from his life and work.

</p><p>
In addition to providing Erdős's biography, the book also tries to fill the
traditional "math for laymen" niche by presenting several relatively simple
problems with solutions, and discussing some of the latest breakthroughts in
mathematics (including a discussion of Wiles' proof of Fermat Last Theorem,
which will be quite boring and repetitive to those who've read Singh's famous
book). 

</p><p>
All in all it's a quick and pleasant read, though not much different from many
other books on this subject. In particular, if you're seeking inspiration, this
isn't the right book to read. Erdős was certainly an one-in-a-million genious
and had major in-born abilities for mathematics. Churning out dozens of papers
in your 70s is no small feat that few of the most brilliant mathematicians in
history managed. The most inspiring parts are perhaps how Erdős attempted to
promote collaboration and openness, by working together with so many different
people, and being a guide and mentor to lots of others.
