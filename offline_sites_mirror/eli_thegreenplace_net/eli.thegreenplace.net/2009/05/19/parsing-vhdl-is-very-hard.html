        <p>Ever since I started writing lots of VHDL code at work, I've been toying with the idea of writing a parser for the language. It would provide me with a simple means for writing useful small tools for organizing and analyzing large bodies of VHDL code.</p>
<p>A few years ago I even started <a class="reference external" href="../../../2004/10/24/a-vhdl-parser-in-perl/index.html">looking into this</a> seriously, but that project got flushed down the tubes once I realized that it's hard to find suitable libraries for this in Perl, which I was using at the time. In addition, VHDL turned out to be a very hairy language to parse.</p>
<p>Lately, after the success of PLY-based <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/pycparser">pycparser</a>, I came back to VHDL. PLY is powerful and fast, I thought, perhaps it's feasible to parse VHDL with it?</p>
<p>Turns out the task is much harder than I expected. Attempting to translate the VHDL <a class="reference external" href="http://tams-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/vhdl/tools/grammar/vhdl93-bnf.html">BNF definition</a> into PLY Yacc runs into problems very quickly. The BNF is not suitable for LALR, and is full of reduce/reduce conflicts. At first I rewrote the rules to make them more general (and hence accept a bit more of invalid code, which wasn't too important for me), but more and more are coming. Yesterday I read some paper claiming that the full translation of the BNF into Yacc results in 576 reduce/reduce errors! Umph...</p>
<p>No problem, I can just rewrite it using a hand-tailored RD parser (which I suspect most commercial VHDL tools are using) that's more powerful than LALR and hence won't be troubled by conflicts in the BNF, right?</p>
<p>It's more difficult than that.</p>
<p>VHDL is context-sensitive in a mean way. Consider this statement inside a process:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>jinx := foo(1);
</pre></div>
<p>Well, depending on the objects defined in the scope of the process (and its enclosing scopes), this can be either:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A function call</li>
<li>Indexing an array</li>
<li>Indexing an array returned by a parameter-less function call</li>
</ul>
<p>To parse this correctly, a parser has to carry a hierarchical symbol table (with enclosing scopes), and the current file isn't even enough. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt> can be a function defined in a package. So the parser should first analyze the packages imported by the file it's parsing, and figure out the symbols defined in them.</p>
<p>This is just an example. The VHDL type/subtype system is a similarly context-sensitive mess that's very difficult to parse.</p>
<p>After some Googling, today I've encountered an old newsgroup post on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">comp.lang.vhdl</span></tt> from 1993, by a bunch of seemingly knowledgeable people discussing this issue. The verdict: yes, it's context-sensitive, and very hard to parse. But with (lots of) effort it's doable.</p>
<p>I'm kind-of bummed by this at the moment. I'll either find something online to adapt, give the RD parser a shot and try to minimize the damage of context-sensitivity, or drop the idea altogether. We'll see...</p>
