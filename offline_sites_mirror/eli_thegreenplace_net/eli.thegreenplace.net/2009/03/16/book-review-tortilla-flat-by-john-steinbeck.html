"Tortilla Flat" tells the story of Danny and his friends, a bunch of Monterey
"paisanos", following their mischiefs over a period of a few months. The
paisanos are basically jobless bums of mixed Spanish-Indian descent, who spend
their days either stealing food or working in odd one-time jobs, and their
nights drinking wine, singing and fighting.
      </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  They live in old wooden houses set in weedy yards, and the pine
  trees from the forest are about the houses. The paisanos are clean of
  commercialism, free of the complicated systems of American business, and,
  having nothing that can be stolen, exploited or mortgaged, that system has not
  attacked them very vigorously.
      </p><p>

What is a paisano? He is a mixture of Spanish, Indian, Mexican and assorted
Caucasian bloods. His ancestors have lived in California for a hundred or two
years. He speaks English with a paisano accent and Spanish with a paisano
accent. When questioned concerning his race, he indignantly claims pure Spanish
blood and rolls up his sleeve to show that the soft inside of his arm is nearly
white. His color, like that of a well-browned meerschaum pipe, he ascribes to
sunburn. He is a paisano, and he lives in that uphill district above the town of
Monterey called Tortilla Flat, although it isn't a flat at all.
      </p>
</blockquote>
      <p>

Steinbeck gets into the soul of a paisano extremely well, and conveys it
masterfully to the reader. The book is actually a loosely coupled collection of
short stories, each highlighting a different aspect of the bunch's way of life
and characters. I just can't stop being amazed by this author, his command of
the language and ability to set you into the background of some period and group
of people, to make you feel like you're actually experiencing the scenes.
      </p><p>

The book is humoristic, and, IMHO quite optimistic. It's heart-warming to read
about these worry-less bums, how they breeze through life happy at their share.
Recommended!
