Secondary title: "Two dozen programmers, three years, 4732 bugs, and one quest
for transcendent software".
      </p><p>

The author has spent 3 years closely documenting the process of developing <a href="http://chandlerproject.org/">Chandler</a>, a Personal Information
Manager. The project was founded by Mitch Kapor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Development">Lotus</a> fame, and funded
by him for several years in order to create a PIM of his dreams. He hired
programmers, designers and managers to implement the thing from scratch, which
served as a very good observation target for Scott Rosenberg.
      </p><p>

The book is one long programming "battle story" - of the kind that you'll find
developers telling one another during lunch. It is a very detailed documentation
of the whole software development process, from early requirements
specification, through design, implementation and testing. It goes into very
intricate programming details from time to time (such as a two-page comparison
between Perl and Python), and hence parts of it would be incomprehensible to
non-programmers. Nevertheless, most of the book can be understood by any reader
that has been involved in any kind of intellectual design work.
      </p><p>

The author tries to understand what makes software development inherently hard.
It provides great and precise insights into the mindsets of programmers over a
wide range of aspects, which is an interesting read. There's no doubt that any
programmer with several years of experience developing software has run into at
least some of the problems the Chandler team ran into. And since Chandler was
(and still is) far from achieving its original goals, even after much more time
and money than initially planned was invested, it also provides insights into
the reason for failure in software projects. 
      </p><p>

I think it's an interesting read for programmers, because it's always
educational to understand how other people ran into the same problems you ran
into, and how they approached to solving them. Also, since the book is
essentially a great post-mortem of a failed project, it serves as an invaluable
resource for understanding what should not be done. It's always better to learn
from someone else's mistakes than from your own.
