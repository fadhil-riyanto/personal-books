In 1960, John Steinbeck decided that he can't keep writing books about America
before he gets himself re-acquainted with the country. So, he packed himself and
his poodle Charley into a camper truck and set out on a 10,000 mile journey
around the U.S. 
</p><p>

Steinbeck's main goal was not to see the changes that the country underwent, but
to <em>feel</em> the thoughts and spirits of the people. Using his dog, freshly
brewed coffee and other ingenious tricks, he initiated contact with numerous
people along his trip and struck conversations, trying to figure out how people
feel about the political situation and life in America in general.
</p><p>

"Travels with Charley" is one of Steinbeck's books I liked the most, and I just
wish it wouldn't be so short! It's rare that I lament the shortness of a book
(over-size is a more frequent complaint) - but I was counting the pages hoping
it won't end. Even as far as travel books go, this one stands out. In contrast
to more modern authors who just wish to visit the most popular places, Steinbeck
tries to avoid them and rather focus on the "real America", on the way providing
interesting insights and thoughts about what he sees and hears. The style of
Steinbeck's writing is, as always, beautiful. Perhaps what makes this book stand
out is its being non-fiction, reflecting the author's real thoughts in first
person, not through a book character. 
</p><p>

Highly recommended!
