Secondary title: "A personal view of the search for god".
      </p><p>

This book wasn't actually written by Sagan, but rather edited from his lectures
by Ann Druyan (his wife and co-author). The lectures were given at the Gifford
Lectures on Natural Theology of 1985 at the university of Glasgow in Scotland -
a very prestigious set of lectures that once featured Heisenberg, Bohr and
Whitehead, among others.
      </p><p>

Druyan spiced up Sagan's lectures by including modern astronomical color photos
taken of distant stars and galaxies (photos that were unavalaible to Sagan in
1985, before the Hubble telescope was launched). With the many illustrations in
it, the book is quite short and can be read in a few hours. It summarizes the
lectures and provides a sample of Q&A; between Sagan and the audience in the end.
      </p><p>

There's not much new about Sagan's views here, especially for hard-core fans
like me who've read most of his books before. However, I don't think that in
other books Sagan speaks of religion so directly - his way of thinking is clear
(for example in "Demon haunted world"), but here he addresses the questions of
God's existence more directly.
      </p><p>

So the book is good if you want a pretty good sample of what scientists think
about religion (in a much milder way than Dawkins says it). It's also a must if
you're a fan of Sagan's writing, of course.
