      <p>
Memory allocation is a fascinating area, ripe in trade-offs and cutting-edge
research. In this book, Bill Blunden manages to provide a pretty-good overview
of the topic. 
      </p><p>

It begins with an introduction of the lowest levels - the hardware, namely the
CPU memory management unit. Then it goes on to explain how operating systems
manage memory - segmentation, paging, virtual memory and what's between them.
Next, memory is examined on the programming-language level - compiler-level and
heap allocation mechanisms in Fortran, COBOL, Pascal, C and finally Java.
      </p><p>

The second part of the book is the practice: the author implements several
manual memory management schemes (own implementations of malloc/free) in C++,
and compares them in terms of performance and other characteristics (like memory
fragmentation). Finally, he implements a couple of simple garbage collectors
(reference-counting, and mark-sweep), and in the last chapter of the book also
briefly mentions the important topic of sub-allocators (also known as "pools" or
"arenas").
      </p><p>

Overall, I enjoyed the book. But I do have a few points of (constructive)
criticism. First of all, the book is a bit too conversational for such a
technical work. It feels like a collection of blog posts, and thus also lacks in
depth. For example, the section on memory management of Windows is quite
disappointing. As much as I can admire the author's attempt to show his
exploration process armed by various tracing and monitoring tools, much of this
information is well known and has been described. Instead, I would expect a more
thorough presentation of the topic.
      </p><p>

The other problem is the C++ code. C++ code in books is a pet peeve of mine -
for some reason it tends to be exceptionally bad in most of them, and this book
is no exception. I won't go into examples because there are simply too many, so
just a word of advice: if you intend to follow through this book actually
implementing the code (always a good idea!) read about the algorithms the author
describes, but write your own implementation. There's nothing good to learn from
the C++ code in this book, so you might as well get some more practice on your
own.
