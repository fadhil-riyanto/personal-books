      <p>
This is Steinbeck's second novel, published in 1933. It tells the story of the
Wayne family - 4 brothers, farmers who moved to California from the east,
focusing on Joseph, who came first and established the farm after the death of
his father.
      </p><p>

True to Steinbeck's style, the main theme of this book is the land of
California, and the special connection of the farmer to it. But there's also
another major theme, which is religion. And it's not "normal" American religion
(protestant Christian), but a weird mixture of it, with ritualistic customs of
local Indians and self-made worship of the land, animals and trees. Steinbeck
tries to explore the topic of religion in this book, and although I felt he's
trying to get somewhere, I couldn't quite figure out where.
      </p><p>

And overall, I liked the book less than other things by Steinbeck. Objectively,
I can go as far as saying that this is the first Steinbeck's book I didn't
really enjoy. Something in it is strange and unfinished, and I know myself for
the strong dislike of anything mystical, so it's not a surprise I didn't connect
with the plot.
      </p><p>

One thing I did like in the book is the character of Thomas. His connection with
animals and very unique character is described beautifully.
      </p><p>

To conclude, I wouldn't recommend "To a God Unknown". IMHO it doesn't present
Steinbeck in his best light.
