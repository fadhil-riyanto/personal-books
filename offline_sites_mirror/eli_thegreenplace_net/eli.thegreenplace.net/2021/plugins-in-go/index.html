                <p>Several years ago I started writing a <a class="reference external" href="../../tag/plugins.html">series of posts</a> on <em>plugins</em>: how they are
designed and implemented in various systems and programming languages. In this,
I'll extend the series by providing some examples of plugins in Go.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a class="reference external" href="../../2012/08/07/fundamental-concepts-of-plugin-infrastructures.html">the original post</a>
in this series identifies four fundamental plugin concepts, and claims that
nearly all plugin systems can be characterized and understood by mapping
their design to these concepts:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Discovery</li>
<li>Registration</li>
<li>Application hooks to which plugins attach (aka. &quot;mount points&quot;)</li>
<li>Exposing application capabilities back to plugins (aka. extension API)</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="two-kinds-of-plugins">
<h2>Two kinds of plugins</h2>
<p>As in other statically compiled programming languages, in Go it's common to talk
about two general kinds of plugins: compile-time plugins and run-time plugins.
We'll cover both kinds here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compile-time-plugins">
<h2>Compile-time plugins</h2>
<p>Compile-time plugins consist of code packages that get compiled into the
application's main binary. Once the binary is built, its functionality is fixed.</p>
<p>The best known example of a compile-time plugin system in Go is drivers for the
<tt class="docutils literal">database/sql</tt> package. I've written <a class="reference external" href="../../2019/design-patterns-in-gos-databasesql-package/index.html">a whole post about this topic</a>
- please read it!</p>
<p>To briefly recap: database drivers are packages that the main application
imports using a blank <tt class="docutils literal">import _ &quot;name&quot;</tt>. These packages then use their
<tt class="docutils literal">init</tt> functions to register with the <tt class="docutils literal">database/sql</tt> package using
<tt class="docutils literal">sql.Register</tt>.</p>
<p>W.r.t. the fundamental plugin concepts, here is how compile-time plugins (and
<tt class="docutils literal">database/sql</tt> as a concrete example) fare:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Discovery: very explicit, with an import of a plugin package. Plugins can
then perform registration automatically in their <tt class="docutils literal">init</tt> function.</li>
<li>Registration: since the plugin is compiled into the main application, it's
straightforward for it to invoke a registration function
(e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">sql.Register</tt>) directly from the plugin.</li>
<li>Application hooks: Typically, a plugin will implement an interface the
application provides and the registration process will hook up the interface
implementation. With <tt class="docutils literal">database/sql</tt>, a plugin will implement the
<tt class="docutils literal">driver.Driver</tt> interface and a value implementing this interface will
be registered using <tt class="docutils literal">sql.Register</tt>.</li>
<li>Exposing application capabilities back to plugins: with compile-time plugins
this is simple; since the plugin is compiled into the binary, it can
just <tt class="docutils literal">import</tt> utility packages from the main application and use these in
its code as needed.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="run-time-plugins">
<h2>Run-time plugins</h2>
<p>Run-time plugins consist of code that does not get compiled into the original
binary of the main application; instead, it hooks up to this application at
run-time. In compiled languages, a common tool to achieve this goal is <em>shared
libraries</em>, and Go supports this approach as well. The rest of this section will
provide an example of developing a plugin system in Go using shared libraries;
alternative approaches will be examined a bit later.</p>
<p>Go comes with a <tt class="docutils literal">plugin</tt> package built into the standard library. This package
lets us write Go programs that get compiled into shared libraries instead of
into executable binaries; further, it provides simple functions for loading
shared libraries and getting symbols from them.</p>
<p>For this post, I've developed a complete example of a run-time plugin system; it
replicates the original <tt class="docutils literal">htmlize</tt> example from the <a class="reference external" href="../../2012/08/07/fundamental-concepts-of-plugin-infrastructures.html">post on plugin
infrastructures</a>,
and its design is similar to the one in the followup post on <a class="reference external" href="../../2012/08/24/plugins-in-c.html">Plugins in C</a>. The example consists
of a simplistic program to convert some markup language (like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">reStructuredText</a> or Markdown) to HTML, with
support for plugins that let us adjust the way certain markup elements are
processed. The full sample code for this post <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/main/2021/go-htmlize-plugin">is available here</a>.</p>
<img alt="Directory contents of the plugin sample" class="align-center" src="../../images/2021/plugin-dir-contents.png" />
<p>Let's examine this sample using the fundamental concepts of plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery and Registration</strong>: accomplished via file system lookup. The
main application has a <tt class="docutils literal">plugin</tt> package with the <tt class="docutils literal">LoadPlugins</tt> function.
This function scans a given directory for files ending with <tt class="docutils literal">.so</tt> and treats
all such files as plugins. It expects to find a global function named
<tt class="docutils literal">InitPlugin</tt> in each shared library, and invokes it providing it a
<tt class="docutils literal">PluginManager</tt> (more on which later).</p>
<p>How did the plugins become <tt class="docutils literal">.so</tt> files in the first place? By building them
with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-buildmode=plugin</span></tt> flag. Look at the <tt class="docutils literal">buildplugins.sh</tt> script and
the README file <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/blob/main/2021/go-htmlize-plugin/">in the code sample</a>
for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Application hooks</strong>: now is a good time to describe the <tt class="docutils literal">PluginManager</tt>
type. This is the main type used for communicating between plugins and the main
application. The flow is as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The application creates a new <tt class="docutils literal">PluginManager</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">LoadPlugins</tt>, and passes
it to all the plugins it finds.</li>
<li>Each plugin uses the <tt class="docutils literal">PluginManager</tt> to register its own handlers for
various hooks.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">LoadPlugins</tt> returns the <tt class="docutils literal">PluginManager</tt> to the main application after
all plugins have registered with it.</li>
<li>When the application runs, it uses <tt class="docutils literal">PluginManager</tt> to invoke
plugin-registered hooks as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, <tt class="docutils literal">PluginManager</tt> has this method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">func</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">pm</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">PluginManager</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">RegisterRoleHook</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">rolename</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">hook</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">RoleHook</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Where <tt class="docutils literal">RoleHook</tt> is a function type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// RoleHook takes the role contents, DB and Post and returns the text this role</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// should be replaced with.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kd">type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">RoleHook</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">content</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">DB</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">content</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Post</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Plugins can invoke <tt class="docutils literal">RegisterRoleHook</tt> to register a handler for a specific
text role. Note that this design doesn't actually use Go interfaces, but
alternative designs could do that; it all depends on the specifics of the
application.</p>
<p><strong>Exposing application capabilities back to plugins</strong>: as you can see in the
<tt class="docutils literal">RoleHook</tt> type above, the application passes data objects to the plugin for
its use. <tt class="docutils literal">content.DB</tt> provides access to the application database, and
<tt class="docutils literal">content.Post</tt> provides the specific post the plugin is currently formatting.
The plugin can use these objects to obtain data or behavior from the
application, as needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="issues-with-shared-library-plugins-in-go">
<h2>Issues with shared library plugins in Go</h2>
<p>Run-time plugins using shared libraries and the <tt class="docutils literal">plugin</tt> package work well for
Go, as the previous section demonstrates. However, this approach also has some
serious downsides. The most important downside is that Go is very picky about
keeping the main application and the shared libraries it loads compatible.</p>
<p>As an experiment, make a small modification in one of the packages used by both
plugins and the main application, rebuild the main application and run it. Most
likely you'll get this error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;plugin was built with a different version of package XXX&quot;
</pre></div>
<p>The reason for this is that Go wants all the versions of all packages in the
main application and plugins to match exactly. It's clear what motivates this:
safety.</p>
<p>Consider C and C++ as a counter-example. In these languages, an application can
load a shared library with <tt class="docutils literal">dlopen</tt> and subsequently use <tt class="docutils literal">dlsym</tt> to obtain
symbols from it. <tt class="docutils literal">dlsym</tt> is extremely weakly typed; it takes a symbol name
and returns a <tt class="docutils literal">void*</tt>. It's up to the user to cast this to a concrete function
type. If the function type changes because of a version update, the result can
very likely be some sort of segmentation fault or even memory corruption.</p>
<p>Since Go relies on shared libraries from plugins, it has the same inherent
safety issues. It tries to protect programmers from shooting themselves in the
foot by ensuring that the application has been built with the same versions of
packages as all its plugins. This helps avoid mismatch. In addition, the version
of the Go compiler used to build the application and plugins must match exactly.</p>
<p>However, this protection comes with downsides - making developing plugins
somewhat cumbersome. Having to rebuild all plugins whenever any common packages
change - even in ways that don't affect the plugin interface - is a heavy
burden. Especially considering that by their very nature plugins are typically
developed separately from the main application; they may live in separate
repositories, have separate release cadences etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alternative-approaches-to-run-time-plugins">
<h2>Alternative approaches to run-time plugins</h2>
<p>Given that the <tt class="docutils literal">plugin</tt> package was only added to Go in <a class="reference external" href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.8">version 1.8</a> and the limitation described previously, it's
not surprising that the Go ecosystem saw the emergence of alternative plugin
approaches.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting directions, IMHO, involves plugins via RPC. I've
always been a fan of decoupling an application into separate processes
communicating via RPC or just TCP on localhost (I guess they
call this <em>microservices</em> these days), since it has several important upsides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Isolation: crash in a plugin does not bring the whole application down.</li>
<li>Interoperability between languages: if RPC is the interface, do you care what
language the plugin is written in?</li>
<li>Distribution: if plugins interface via the network, we can easily distribute
them to run on different machines for gains in performance, reliability, and
so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, Go makes this particularly easy by having a fairly capable RPC package
right in the standard library: <tt class="docutils literal">net/rpc</tt>.</p>
<p>One of the most widely used RPC-based plugin systems is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin">hashicorp/go-plugin</a>. Hashicorp is well known for creating
great Go software, and apparently they use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">go-plugin</span></tt> for many of their
systems, so it's battle-tested (though its documentation could be better!)</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">go-plugin</span></tt> runs on top of <tt class="docutils literal">net/rpc</tt> but also supports gRPC. Advanced RPC
protocols like gRPC are well suitable for plugins because they include
versioning out-of-the-box, tackling the difficult interoperability problem
between different versions of plugins vs. the main application.</p>
<p><strong>Update (2023-03-28)</strong>: <a class="reference external" href="../../2023/rpc-based-plugins-in-go/index.html">here's a post</a>
about using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">go-plugin</span></tt> to implement the same functionality.</p>
