                <p>A comprehensive introduction to writing an interpreter for a dynamically typed,
object-oriented toy programming language (Lox). Throughout the book the author
develops two complete interpreters for the language from start to finish,
including all the front-end and backend parts. The first is a simple AST walking
interpreter implemented in Java, and the second is a moderately optimized VM
written in C, including a garbage collector.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a great teaching approach and it mirrors the one I took in my
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/bobscheme">Bob project</a> almost exactly <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>The book follows an interesting plan - all the code for both interpreters is
fully included in the text and presented in pieces. You don't need anything
additional - no external packages, no external repositories to look at. If you
use the same language(s) the author chose, just read along and copy the code
into your editor. It will work. In this approach lies the book's strength and
also its weakness, as I will explain below.</p>
<p>If this is the first interpreter you ever write, I do recommend following this
approach (using the same languages the book uses). Otherwise, you may be tempted
to follow along but implement your interpreter in <em>another</em> language. This is
much more challenging, though, especially with the second (C-based) interpreter
which uses a lot of C idiosyncrasies. I personally reimplemented the complete
first interpreter in Go as I went along with the book - this was very easy. For
the second one I picked Rust and reimplemented about 2/3rds of <tt class="docutils literal">clox</tt> in it
before running out of steam. Since I already wrote Bob in the past I felt like I
wasn't learning much new and I wasn't particularly interested in Lox's OOP
features anyway.</p>
<p>I'll state the conclusion of my review here, before moving on: this book is
really great. Especially if you haven't had too much exposure to writing
compilers in the past. Among the many compiler books I've seen/read, this is by
far the most practical. It's hard for me to judge how beginner-friendly it is
since I have quite a bit of background on this subject, but coupled with a more
theoretical compilation book or course, it should be absolutely terrific to get
anyone started. The attention to detail is nothing short of amazing - I don't
think I found a single mistake in this book, even a typo. The code is well
thought out, the explanations are solid and the diagrams are delightful.</p>
<p>Now on to some (minor) criticism: remember how I said that placing all the code
in the book is somewhat of a weakness? Well, this is for a few reasons. First,
the book is <em>enormous</em>. Long, large, heavy. It's hard to read the physical book
in any other way than laid flat on top of a table. Second, because it's so large
and packed already, the author left quite a few things out, particularly
testing. There's precious little actual Lox code in the book, and no testing
strategy <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>. Testing interpreters well is relatively easy and very powerful,
especially when implementing multiple ones for the same language. I do
understand the space constraints, however.</p>
<p>Also, I fell like the sticking to single-pass compilation needlessly complicates
the interpreter, and is unwarranted in this day and age. But doing a two-pass
compiler would likely have made the book even longer.</p>
<p>A more subtle issue with writing all the code down in sequence is that the
author tries very hard to keep it working at all times without refactoring too
much, and this means that early code sometimes has subtle provisions for the
future. Especially when re-implementing in another language, these are a
constant source of grief - &quot;oh I don't need this field in my language&quot;, and
50 pages later &quot;oops, now I understand why it was there&quot;. It's full of
Chesterton's fences! These are excusable for an old and dusty code base, but not
for new code being developed on the fly. So my advice to you, if you're reading
the book and implementing along in another language - beware of these! Read a
chapter or two ahead before going back and actually implementing.</p>
<p>As I said, these criticisms are minor, and I understand the constraints the
author was acting under - making the book even larger would have
been difficult. Overall, it's a very good book; it fills an important niche in
the compiler literature, and <em>someone</em> just had to write it. I'm happy Bob
Nystrom did.</p>
