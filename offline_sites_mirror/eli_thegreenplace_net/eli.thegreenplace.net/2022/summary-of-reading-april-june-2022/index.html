                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;Pathfinder: John C. Fremont and the Course of American Empire&quot; by Tom
Chaffin - a comprehensive biography of Fremont, focusing on his famous
cross-continent journeys of discovery. Though long drawn at times, this
book is good and provides an interesting glimpse into a critical time
in Californian history</li>
<li>&quot;If Not Now, When?&quot; by Primo Levi - historical fiction about a group of
Jewish partisans in Russia, Ukraine and Poland during the second half of
WWII. Beautiful writing and an unusual, highly realistic writing style.
While the book is fiction, it's very different from what would be considered
a &quot;thriller&quot; or &quot;action&quot; genre these days - it seems to reflect reality much
better.</li>
<li>&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; by Charlotte BrontÃ« - although I found the last quarter or so of
the book a bit too fantastical, overall it's a really excellent novel that I
somehow neglected to read in the past. Very good writing and character
development; given that the book was written in 1847 it's clear why it is
considered to be an important early work of feminism.</li>
<li>&quot;Ingredients&quot; by George Zaidan - secondary title is &quot;The strange chemistry
of what we put in us and on us&quot;. An interesting take on nutrition and the
science behind it. I liked this book, though all the toilet humor and other
dirty jokes are off-putting.</li>
<li>&quot;Missions to Mars&quot; by Larry Crumpler - a comprehensive account of all the
exploration missions launched to Mars to date, from the POV of a planetary
geologist that took part in some of them. This book has a lot of good
material, but the delivery is very dry - not sure if it's the original text
or the audio narration to blame here.</li>
<li>&quot;Out of my Mind&quot; by Sharon M. Draper - a nice book for young readers about
a highly intelligent 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy.</li>
<li>&quot;Less&quot; by Andrew Sean Greer - this is what happens when you pick up a book
just because it won a Pulitzer, knowing basically zero about it otherwise.
I'm pretty sure I'm missing a lot of cultural context to have enjoyed this
one.</li>
<li>&quot;Quickstart Molecular Biology&quot; by Philip N. Benfey - short fast-paced
introduction to modern molecular biology and generics. Parts of the book are
very readable and interesting, parts are completely inscrutable. It covers
some very new analysis techniques, which is nice.</li>
<li>&quot;The Lincoln Highway&quot; by Amor Towles - having really loved the author's
&quot;A Gentleman in Moscow&quot;, I had high hopes for this book. It's an odd one! The
plot is confusing, mixed up with the points of view of multiple characters,
and is not moving in a coherent direction. While the writing is of high
quality, it feels like the author is frolicking in his skill and not trying to
put a cohesive plot together.</li>
<li>&quot;Rust for Rustaceans&quot; by Jon Gjengset - I had high expectations from this book
because I really enjoyed watching some of the author's videos in the past.
Unfortunately it turned out to be disappointing. The book mixes material that
is much better explained in Rust's official book with material that's too
specialized, IMHO. The choice of subjects could be more palatable if the
exposition was better, but the book is just walls upon walls of text, with
very little in terms of diagrams and code samples. There are barely any
compilable projects that do something useful - the book's code samples are
small snippets that are rarely self contained. I'll keep it handy in case it
serves as a useful reference in the future, and will update the review if
this turns out to be the case.</li>
<li>&quot;The Science of Energy&quot; by Michael E. Wysession - (audio course) an
interesting and detailed coverage of energy consumption and production,
with lots of fascinating numbers and statistics. No drama or hyperbolics,
which are so frequent in press coverage of this topic. The author's
explanations are definitely grounded in reality. Though the course is not
very old (from 2014), it's fascinating to see how much has changed -
particularly the speed of adoption of renewable energies, electric cars and
so on.</li>
<li>&quot;The Pattern on the Stone&quot; by W. Daniel Hillis - the subtitle is &quot;The simple
ideas that make computers work&quot;. An OK book, though it's not clear what the
intended audience is. When the book was originally written in 1998, it may
have been useful for engineering-oriented folks who weren't familiar with
computers; in this day and age, do such people really exist? For learning
the basics of how computers work, Petzold's &quot;Code&quot; is far superior.</li>
<li>&quot;Energy: A Human History&quot; by Richard Rhodes - stories of people involved in
the leaps of human energy technology - from wood in medieval England to
nuclear power and renewables in the 21st century. The writing is very good,
but I feel like the book is lacking something to tie it all together. Still,
a fairly interesting read.</li>
<li>&quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot; by L.M. Montgomery - the first sequel to &quot;Anne of Green
Gables&quot;, where Anne is now a 17-year-old school teacher. It involves many of
the same characters from the first book as well as a number of new ones. This
is once again a mix between a book for kids and charming old-style romance,
with a dollop of good sense of humor. I liked the first book more, though.</li>
<li>&quot;How to drive a nuclear reactor&quot; by Colin Tucker - a very interesting and
detailed explanation of how Pressurised Water Reactors (the most common type
of commercial nuclear power reactors) work, starting from the physics and all
the way to an exteremely detailed discussion of the various safety systems
involved. It's easy to get infected with the writer's obvious enthusiasm and
love of the subject, and the writing style is very direct and clear. This
book will likely go into way too much detail for most readers, but it's still
a great read if you're wondering how nuclear power stations really work.</li>
