                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;Justice for All: Earl Warren and the Nation He Made&quot; - a nice and detailed
biography of Earl Warren.</li>
<li>&quot;The Silk Roads: A New History of the World&quot; by Peter Frankopak - a fast-paced
whirlwhind of world history from pre-historic times and until the early
2010s, with a focus on central Asia. Not a bad book, though very scattered
given the enormous scope and limited space. What bothers me is that the book's
premise is to re-tell history without focusing on Europe and focusing on Asia
instead; IMHO it fails miserably in this task, still focusing mostly on
Europe, and on Asia only inasmuch as its connection to Europe. More text is
spent on explaining English commercial interests in China than on the history
of China itself.</li>
<li>&quot;How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming&quot; by Mike Brown  - an entertaining
story of the astronomical research that led to the demotion of Pluto to
the status of a &quot;dwarf planet&quot;. The author is the astronomer who discovered
the other prominent dwarf planets to date (Eris, Haumea and Makemake), and
this book has more scientific detail than deGrasse Tyson's book on the
same subject.</li>
<li>&quot;The Future of Fusion Energy&quot; by J. Parisi and J. Ball -
<a class="reference external" href="../book-review-the-future-of-fusion-energy-by-j-parisi-and-j-ball/index.html">full review</a>.</li>
<li>&quot;Who We Are and How We Got Here&quot; by David Reich - the author is a researcher
in the domain of population-level DNA analysis, specializing at analyzing
&quot;ancient DNA&quot; from archaeological remains of humans to track the movements
and interactions of human populations in the ancient and more recent past.
This book is a summary of recent research (as of 2018) in this fast-moving
field. It covers several interesting subjects and presents fascinating
findings from very recent research breakthroughts; on the flip side, the
writing style is somewhat dry and overly academic. From reading this book,
it's difficult to discern how speculative the information presented is; some
if it is certainly very new, published in recent papers. An interesting field
of study to keep track of in the future.</li>
<li>&quot;Dreams of El Dorado: A History of the American West&quot; by H. W. Brands - a
fast-paced overview of notable events in the history of the Western USA. Nice
read, though necessarily somewhat shallow given the scope.</li>
<li>&quot;Learning HTTP/2&quot; by S. Ludin and J. Garza - a very short (barely 100 pages)
book about the performance issues with HTTP/1.1 and how HTTP/2 was designed
to resolve them. Overall it's a nice little book, though I feel the authors
could have beefed it up quite a bit. While the performance discussions are
insightful, I found the explanation of how the HTTP/2 protocol actually works
lacking. More details on that, and perhaps even a simple educational
implementation would go a long way and the book could still be kept to under
200 pages.</li>
<li>&quot;The Trial&quot; by Franz Kafka - from time to time I'm giving classics a try.
This book interested me because it begat some cultural memes; it turned out to
be far more weird than I imagined. Towards the end I think I &quot;got&quot; the main
point of it, and it's a powerful - albeit depressing - one, but so much about
the story is bizarre without any obvious connection to the main plot that I
can discern.</li>
<li>&quot;Immune&quot; by Philipp Dettmer - a description of how the immune system works,
for the layperson. The immune system is incredibly complicated and
intertwined, and scientific understanding of all its details is still far from
perfect, so the author took upon himself an ambitious task. The execution is
pretty good; not amazing, but the book is certainly useful and enjoyable. I
found the general tone somewhat rambly, there are too many analogies and too
few diagrams, but given the complexity of the topic I'm quite happy with the
increased understanding I have after having finished the book.</li>
<li>&quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; by L. Frank Baum - got around to reading this
book end-to-end again with my kids (the last time I read it was maybe 30
years ago). As usual, it's difficult to appreciate books out of their
historical context; for example, old reviews say this was the &quot;first really
American fairytale&quot;, with elements of corn farming and self-made men, as
opposed to the classical fairytales that describe European peasant life of
centuries past. Another observation is how shockingly violent this story is.
When a wild cat is chasing a mouse and the axeman decapitates it without much
thought, my daughter was appalled - the wild cat just wants to eat, why is its
life less important than the mouse's? After all, the Lion was described as
&quot;going into the forest to catch his lunch&quot; just a few pages ago; where's the
justice here? Interestingly, the same review I read pointed out that compared
to the old fairy tales this books is gentle for the &quot;currente generation of
American children&quot;, the &quot;current generation&quot; being 100+ years ago when the
book was first published. It's interesting to ponder this downard progression
in violence in children literature, and how it's correlated humanity's general
progression.</li>
<li>&quot;Gideon's Trumpet&quot; by Anthony Lewis - tells the story of the landmark
Supreme Court case of Gideon v. Wainwright, that ruled that defendants in
trials have the right to an attorney even if they don't have the means to
afford one. It's really an amazing story - a determined person who
punched way above his weight and affected a significant and lasting change in
the US criminal justice system. The book is very well written - I particularly
enjoyed all the details of the Supreme Court's workings. It's a bit heavy and
academic at times though - probably a very useful read for law students
interested in constitutional law.</li>
<li>&quot;The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World&quot; by Niall Ferguson - an
overview of the roots of the modern financial system. Written in an
entertaining style based on many anecdotes, this book feels like it's biting
off more than it can chew. It's not a bad book, but nothing to rave about.</li>
