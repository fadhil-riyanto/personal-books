                <p>After 9 years, it's time to retire my <a class="reference external" href="../../2013/11/23/a-new-ubuntu-machine-for-home/index.html">old and faithful home Linux machine</a>. It
has served me extremely well, by far the longest time I've used a home computer
without any replacements. The fans were starting to show their age, to the
extent that the CPU fan sometimes needs a nudge to start after the machine has
been off. While this can be fixed, I also wanted a somewhat faster machine with
more memory.</p>
<p>I've long been keeping a curious eye on <a class="reference external" href="https://system76.com/">system76</a>;
they build and sell HW that was designed for Linux from the start. While my
old machine - which was just a custom build - handled Linux fine over the years,
it did exhibit some snags here and there (Bluetooth, for example). It would be
nice not to deal with this and have HW that <em>just works</em>.</p>
<img alt="System76 meerkat machine" class="align-center" src="../../images/2022/meerkat.html" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>So I went ahead and ordered a &quot;Meerkat&quot; model, which is a really tiny 4.5&quot;x4.5&quot;
box (with a comically large power adapter) that manages to pack 32 GiB of
memory, a sizable SSD and a 4-core (8-thread) i5-1135G7 CPU. It came with
Ubuntu 22.04 preinstalled and was very quick and easy to set up. I
moved all my daily operations to this machine a couple of hours after unpacking
it. Just the computer itself changed - it's still the same monitor, keyboard
and mouse. I could finally use my Bluetooth earphones with it, without any
issues.</p>
<p>It's about 33% faster than my older machine (at least for compiling the Go
toolchain and medium-sized Rust projects), and it's nice to have twice as much
memory and a larger SSD. I'm quite happy with it so far. It's not
the cheapest option out there, but it <em>is</em> a &quot;pay for high quality with minimum
fuss&quot; option.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2024.11.02</strong>: I replaced this computer after two years. It's still
working great, but was becoming a bit underpowered for my needs, especially
because it lacks a GPU. Being pretty happy with System76, I went for a <a class="reference external" href="https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-mira">Thelio Mira</a>
with an i7-13700K CPI (16 Cores - 24 Threads 8P+8E), 64 GiB of memory and
an inexpensive gaming-class Nvidia GPU.</p>
