                <p>Over the summer my family has experienced a brief renaissance of interest in
Sudoku, particularly as I've tried to get my kids to practice solving some
non-trivial puzzles (pro tip: YouTube videos help).</p>
<object class="align-center" data="../../images/2022/sudoku-puzzle.svg" type="image/svg+xml">Sudoku puzzle sample</object>
<p>Naturally, whenever a programmer encounters Sudoku it's hard to avoid thinking
about automated solvers. In fact, I've already written <a class="reference external" href="../../2007/04/08/sudoku-as-a-sat-problem.html">a Sudoku solver many
years ago</a>;
it converts the puzzle into a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">SAT problem</a> and solves
that using a standard SAT solver.</p>
<p>This time I wanted something more conventional, because I was also interested in
generating Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty. In addition, I wanted to
experiment with running Go code in the browser via WebAssembly. The result is
the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/go-sudoku">go-sudoku repository</a>; this post
describes what it does and how to use it. The Go package in my repository is
best seen as a <em>toolkit</em> for solving, generating and evaluating the difficulty
of Sudoku puzzles.</p>
<div class="section" id="solving-puzzles">
<h2>Solving puzzles</h2>
<p>I started from Peter Norvig's fantastic <a class="reference external" href="https://norvig.com/sudoku.html">Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle</a>, where he describes a
constraint-satisfaction solver written in Python. The solver only employs basic
row/column/block elimination as a solution strategy and then runs a recursive
search when stuck. This approach is very fast for solving Sudoku puzzles that
have a single solution.</p>
<p>Norvig's solver in Python is already quick, but my Go code is <em>far</em> faster still
- around 100x faster in some informal measurements. One reason for this is that
Go - in general - is more efficient than Python. Another is a key optimization
to the core data structure; Norvig's code uses a string to represent the
possible digits in a Sudoku square; e.g. if some square can have any value
except 2, it's represented as the string &quot;13456789&quot;. So there's a lot of string
allocation, deallocation and linear scanning. I've replaced this by a single
<tt class="docutils literal">uint16</tt> in Go with bitwise operations to add/remove/test digits. My solver
burns through Norvig's list of &quot;hard&quot; Sudoku puzzles taking less than a <em>quarter
of a millisecond</em> per puzzle on average.</p>
<p>I've also added a <tt class="docutils literal">SolveAll</tt> function that finds <em>all</em> solutions of a given
Sudoku puzzle; careful - do not run this on an empty board :-)</p>
<p>In the repository, you can try the solver by running the <tt class="docutils literal">cmd/solver</tt> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="more-powerful-sudoku-solving-strategies">
<h2>More powerful Sudoku solving strategies</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, my solver follows Norvig's in that it only applies the basic
&quot;first-order&quot; constraint propagation technique to Sudoku - elimination. Expert
human Sudoku solvers have many higher-order techniques at their disposal. For
my solver, I experimented with implementing one of them - <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sudokuoftheday.com/techniques/naked-pairs-triples">Naked Pairs</a>
(alternatively known as &quot;Naked Twins&quot;).</p>
<p>While the implementation works (check out the <tt class="docutils literal">ApplyTwinsStrategy</tt> function),
I found that it's not very helpful for the automated solver. The backtracking
search is so fast that burdening it with additional strategies makes
it <em>slower</em>, not faster. YMMV.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="generating-puzzles">
<h2>Generating puzzles</h2>
<p>Solving puzzles was just the warmump - I've done this before and just wanted
the infrastructure set up. What I was really after is <em>generating</em> interesting
Sudoku puzzles.</p>
<p>The approach Norvig uses is:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Start from an empty board</li>
<li>Assign random digits to random squares until a contradiction is reached
(the puzzle becomes unsolvable), or a minimum count of assigned squares
is reached.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, most puzzles produced this way will have multiple solutions; if
you've done a bit of manual Sudoku-ing, you'll know that puzzles with multiple
solutions suck - no one likes them.</p>
<p>Instead, we can start with an empty board:</p>
<object class="align-center" data="../../images/2022/sudoku-empty.svg" type="image/svg+xml">Empty Sudoku board</object>
<p>Then, we solve the board using a randomized solver (a solver which randomizes
the order of guessed digits it tries to assign to empty squares); this is a very
quick process (tens of micro-seconds) that produces a random <em>valid</em> solution:</p>
<object class="align-center" data="../../images/2022/sudoku-solved.svg" type="image/svg+xml">Random solved sudoku</object>
<p>Now, we remove numbers from squares on the board one by one (in random order).
At each step, we make sure that the resulting board still has a single solution.
We stop when some pre-set threshold is reached - number of remaining hints,
some difficulty estimate, etc.</p>
<p>Compared to the method used by Norvig, this approach has a powerful advantage:
the produced puzzle is guaranteed to have a single solution. It also has a
limitation: it's challenging to generate extremely hard puzzles with very low
hint counts. That said, the puzzles it generates can certainly be hard enough
for non-experts, so it's not a huge problem in practice <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="estimating-puzzle-difficulty">
<h2>Estimating puzzle difficulty</h2>
<p>Estimating the difficulty of Sudoku puzzles is important if you want to generate
puzzles for others to solve. The most enjoyable puzzles are just
at the right level of difficulty - not too easy and not too hard. The estimation
process itself is fairly complicated and heuristic, and there are academic
papers written on the subject.</p>
<p>In the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">go-sudoku</span></tt> package the evaluation (<tt class="docutils literal">EvaluateDifficulty</tt>) is inspired
by the paper &quot;Sudoku Puzzles Generating: from Easy to Evil&quot; by Xiang-Sun ZHANG's
research group, with some tweaks. The difficulty score is provided on a scale
from 1.0 (easiest) to 5.0 (hardest). Generally, I find that puzzles with
difficulty 3 or above are pretty hard!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="web-interface">
<h2>Web interface</h2>
<p>Since my ultimate goal was to generate printable Sudoku puzzles for my family, I
wanted a simple graphical interface one could use to generate puzzles and print
those that look good. Instead of mucking with GUIs or PDFs, I decided to embrace
the web! This is achieved in two steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">go-sudoku</span></tt> package can emit any Sudoku board into a SVG image.</li>
<li>Using Go's <tt class="docutils literal">wasm</tt> backend, the package is compiled to WebAssembly and
attached to a simple JS/HTML frontend.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result is quite pleasing - <a class="reference external" href="https://eliben.github.io/go-sudoku/">you can check it out online</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>; here's a screenshot:</p>
<img alt="Screenshot from web interface" class="align-center" src="../../images/2022/sudoku-web-browser.png" />
<p>The &quot;Hint count&quot; box tells the generator how many hints (non-empty squares) to
leave on the board. For low counts (lower than 25 or so) it should be treated
as a lower bound; the generator will often generate puzzles with slightly more
hints. Also, the lower the hint count, the longer it might take to run.</p>
<p>Compiling my Go code to WebAssembly turned out to be surprisingly easy! If
you're interested in seeing how it works, take a look at the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/go-sudoku/tree/main/cmd/wasm">cmd/wasm directory</a>
in the repository.</p>

<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#footnote-reference-1">[1]</a></td><td><p class="first">Generating truly hard Sudoku puzzles with a single solution is a bit of
an art. Typically, a long time is spent in computational search to
generate a single very hard puzzle.</p>
<p class="last">Once we have a single puzzle with a single solution, we can transform it
in many ways, keeping it valid but with a completely different &quot;look and
feel&quot;. For example, we can transpose rows and columns (within the same
block); we can rotate the puzzle by 90, 180 and 270 degrees; we can
permute its digits arbitrarily, and so on. In the end, a huge number of
variations can be produced - all of the same difficulty.</p>
