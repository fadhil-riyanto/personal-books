                <p>It's been a while since I've last <a class="reference external" href="../../2014/03/27/rewriting-the-lexer-benchmark-in-go.html">rewritten my favorite lexical analyzer</a>
:-) That post is the last in a series implementing a lexer for the <a class="reference external" href="https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/">TableGen
language</a> in a variety of programming
languages, using multiple techniques. The last lexer written, in Go, was very
fast indeed - processing 1 MiB of source in about 20 milliseconds.</p>
<p>The other day I started wondering whether Go compiler improvements from the last
few years made this code run any faster. Back in 2014 I measured it with Go 1.2,
and now Go 1.18 is out. So I tried (on the same machine) with some newer Go
versions; the full code for this is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/main/2014/tablegen-lexer-go">still here</a>,
and the benchmark is run as follows <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ TDINPUT=input.td go test -bench=Preall -benchtime=5s
</pre></div>
<p>These are the results:</p>
<img alt="Benchmark results for different Go versions" class="align-center" src="../../images/2022/lexer-benchmark-per-go-version.png" />
<p>Go 1.5 is comparable to 1.2, but by 1.10 there was a significant improvement
in performance, and a further improvement in later versions. The code produced
by Go 1.18 is more than twice as fast as the original lexer. Now it takes only
~9.6 ms to process the same 1 MiB of TableGen source!</p>
<div class="section" id="looking-deeper-into-the-performance-of-this-lexer">
<h2>Looking deeper into the performance of this lexer</h2>
<p>This got me curious - what <em>does</em> the lexer spend its time on? Since Go has
fantastic tooling for performance profiling, time to whip up some flags... This
will be for the most recent version of Go (1.18):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ TDINPUT=input.td go test -cpuprofile cpu.out -bench=Preall -benchtime=5s

# --nodefraction tells pprof to ignore nodes that take less than 5% of the
# total time - this significantly reduces the clutter in the produced graph

</pre></div>
<p>Here's the important part of the profile:</p>
<img alt="pprof CPU profile for the lexer" class="align-center" src="../../images/2022/lexer-pprof-cpu.png" />
<p>As expected, the <tt class="docutils literal">next</tt> function is very heavy in the profile, as it should
be, since this is the main code taking characters from the input stream and
making them ready for the lexer to process:</p>

<p>Assuming that most characters in the stream are within ASCII bounds, what this
function does on each call is very little. FWIW, it's very similar to how the
inner loop of Go's own <tt class="docutils literal">text/scanner</tt> package works.</p>
<p>But notice the 16.5% spent on <tt class="docutils literal">slicebytetostring</tt> - what is that all
about? Note that it's invoked from several <tt class="docutils literal">scan*</tt> methods. This has to be
the <tt class="docutils literal">string</tt> conversion of buffer slices, e.g. from <tt class="docutils literal">scanIdentifier</tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Token</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">IDENTIFIER</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">string</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">lex</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">buf</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">startpos</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nx">lex</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">rpos</span><span class="p">]),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">startpos</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>In Go, strings are immutable while <tt class="docutils literal">[]byte</tt> is mutable; the two cannot safely
alias. Therefore, when we have some <tt class="docutils literal">b []byte</tt> and we do <tt class="docutils literal">string(b)</tt>, Go
allocates a copy of the slice to a new location and creates a string header to
point to it.</p>
<p>We can verify this by running memory profiling and looking at the allocations:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ TDINPUT=input.td go test -memprofile=mem.mprof -bench=Preall -benchtime=5s
...

$ go tool pprof --alloc_objects example.com.test mem.mprof

<p>As expected, many allocations come from the suspected line. Looking back at the
CPU profiling graph, we also see that much of the run-time of
<tt class="docutils literal">slicebytetostirng</tt> is spent on the allocation (<tt class="docutils literal">mallocgc</tt>). This is
actually a good clue to the stark performance improvement in Go since 1.2; while
the compiler certainly became better since then (especially with the
register-based ABI <a class="reference external" href="../interface-method-calls-with-the-go-register-abi/index.html">introduced in 1.17</a>),
it didn't improve <em>that</em> much. What did improve a whole lot is the garbage
collector; many allocations mean lots of heap to scan and track, and lots of
garbage to clean up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="avoiding-allocations-with-sub-strings">
<h2>Avoiding allocations with sub-strings</h2>
<p>Before we move on, let's get one thing out of the way. There are all kinds of
tricks you can play in Go using <tt class="docutils literal">unsafe</tt> to explicitly alias byte slices and
strings and thus avoid allocations; this is even done <a class="reference external" href="https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Builder.String">in the standard library</a>. I'll leave this topic out of
this post and may cover it separately in the future.</p>
<p>I did wonder about the cost of these allocations, though; what if we avoid all
the copies? At the moment, the lexer's API is such that it takes a <tt class="docutils literal">[]byte</tt> as
input:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">func</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">NewLexer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">buf</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[]</span><span class="kt">byte</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">Lexer</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>And the tokens we return have <tt class="docutils literal">string</tt> values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Token</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">Name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">TokenName</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">Val</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">Pos</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>What if we created a lexer with a <tt class="docutils literal">string</tt> input instead? Since Go strings
are immutable, subslices alias each other and are trivial to create and pass
around; consider this code sample:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">s</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;hello there&quot;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nx">s2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">s</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">:]</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>When <tt class="docutils literal">s</tt> is created, it allocates an 11-byte sequence of bytes and creates a
<a class="reference external" href="https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#StringHeader">2-word string header</a> in <tt class="docutils literal">s</tt>: a
pointer to the sequence of bytes and a <tt class="docutils literal">len</tt> field with the value 11. When the
second line is run, Go just creates a new string header that points into the
same byte buffer (with offset 6) and length 5. There are no allocations (string
headers are typically created on the stack just like integers).</p>
<p>So I went ahead and rewrote the lexer using this different API; the code changes
are pretty minor and the full code is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/main/2014/tablegen-lexer-go/lexer-string">available here</a>.
The <tt class="docutils literal">scanIdentifier</tt> method now looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">func</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">lex</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">Lexer</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">scanIdentifier</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Token</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="nx">lex</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">next</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Token</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">IDENTIFIER</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">lex</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">buf</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">startpos</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nx">lex</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">rpos</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">startpos</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note there's no <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">string(...)</span></tt> cast for the token value; since <tt class="docutils literal">lex.buf</tt> is
already a <tt class="docutils literal">string</tt> in this version, that wouldn't be necessary. Instead, we
just return a string slice, which creates a new 2-word header (instead of
allocating a new string and copying the data into it).</p>
<p>If we benchmark this version, it runs in 7.7 ms for our input, about 20% faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-this-a-good-api-though">
<h2>Is this a good API though?</h2>
<p>OK, so we found a way to further improve the performance of the lexer by taking
a <tt class="docutils literal">string</tt> input; is this API useful though? Is it common for users of
a lexer to have a fully formed <tt class="docutils literal">string</tt>? To be fair, the question applies
equally to the existing <tt class="docutils literal">[]byte</tt> API. IMHO, in most cases the answer is <em>it
depends</em>. If the input to parse is already in memory (say, it was entered into
some sort of text box in your GUI), then yes, <tt class="docutils literal">string</tt> is fine in an API.
More typically, though, this data is read from <em>somewhere</em>.</p>
<p>Go has useful I/O interfaces like <tt class="docutils literal">io.Reader</tt>; this interface encapsulates
&quot;a place we read data from&quot;, and this data is typically read incrementally;
e.g. you don't slurp the whole input file in a single go, but read it in chunks
as needed. My old-ish SSD has read speeds in the order of 500 MiB / sec, meaning
that a 1 MiB file will take about 2 ms to read from disk. If we really care
about performance, overlapping this read with lexing makes sense. But this
brings us to a <tt class="docutils literal">io.Reader</tt> based API, where our substring optimization won't
really work.</p>
<p>Let's see how Go itself does it; the <a class="reference external" href="https://pkg.go.dev/text/scanner">text/scanner package</a> is initialized thus:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">func</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">s</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">Scanner</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">src</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">io</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Reader</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">Scanner</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>And to obtain the text of a token, you call <tt class="docutils literal">TokenText</tt>, which returns a
<tt class="docutils literal">string</tt>. If we look under the hood, <tt class="docutils literal">TokenText</tt> does the equivalent of
<tt class="docutils literal">string(some []byte buffer)</tt>, which incurs an allocation and copy.</p>
<p>When the API is <tt class="docutils literal">io.Reader</tt>, there's really no choice for this, though. It's
really hard to safely return a <tt class="docutils literal">string</tt> that aliases part of a <tt class="docutils literal">[]byte</tt>
buffer accumulated from reading some external source. This is what other
standard library package do as well - <tt class="docutils literal">io.Reader</tt> input is very idiomatic.</p>
<p>The Go compiler itself has a lexical scanner in
<tt class="docutils literal">src/cmd/compile/internal/scanner.go</tt>, and it also takes an <tt class="docutils literal">io.Reader</tt> (in
its <tt class="docutils literal">init</tt> method); naturally, it also has to allocate and copy literal values
with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">string(...)</span></tt> conversion (these are stored in its <tt class="docutils literal">lit</tt> field).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="garbage-collector">
<h2>Garbage Collector</h2>
<p>We're not done yet. Let's look at the profile of the string version, using
the same profiling invocation as before:</p>
<img alt="pprof CPU profile for the lexer string version" class="align-center" src="../../images/2022/lexer-pprof-cpu-2.png" />
<p>We see that our <tt class="docutils literal">Lexer</tt> methods no longer allocate heap data - that's good!
We can prove this further by looking at memory profiling or the compiler's
escape analysis with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-gcflags=&quot;-m&quot;</span></tt> - I'll leave this as an exercise for
diligent readers.</p>
<p>That said, the garbage collector (GC) still clearly runs, taking non-trivial %s
of CPU, as we can see from the right side of the graph. Why does this happen?</p>
<p>This is a good example of why benchmarking is tricky, particularly in GC'd
languages. The Go GC is concurrent, running &quot;silently&quot; alongside our application
whenever it sees fit. In benchmarking situations, this often depends on the
nature of the specific benchmark; specifically, in our benchmark the
top-level function <tt class="docutils literal">tokenizeAllPrealloc</tt> is invoked in a loop. This function
pre-allocates a slice of 200k tokens with <tt class="docutils literal">make</tt>. Each <tt class="docutils literal">Token</tt> in our
lexer occupies 4 words, which is 32 bytes on my 64-bit machine. Overall,
the pre-allocation of the token slice takes somewhere on the order of 6.4 MiB.
Running in a benchmarking loop for 5 seconds results in over 700 cycles, for a
total of 4.5 GiB of heap data (disregarding any additional heap the benchmarking
machinery uses) - which is a lot!</p>
<p>Go lets us control GC behavior with the <tt class="docutils literal">GOGC</tt> env var, which sets the
percentage of heap growth that triggers a collection cycle. The default is 100,
which means a cycle is triggered when the heap doubles. If we use
<tt class="docutils literal">GODEBUG=gctrace=1</tt> to trace GC invocations, we'll see that the GC runs over
700 cycles during our benchmark; clearly, this affects performance.</p>
<p>What happens if we try to tweak <tt class="docutils literal">GOGC</tt>? Here's a chart for different values:</p>
<img alt="Run-time with different values of GOGC" class="align-center" src="../../images/2022/lexer-runtime-gogc.png" />
<p>The fastest run of ~6 ms is achieved with <tt class="docutils literal">GOGC=1600</tt> and stays stable
thereafter. Using tracing again, we see that with this setting the GC only
runs ~50 times during the 5 sec benchmark, compared to 700+ previously.
FWIW, disabling GC entirely with <tt class="docutils literal">GOGC=off</tt> produces a slightly slower
run-time at 6.5 ms (there's quite a lot of data here, so an overly large heap
may occasionally lead to swapping).</p>
<p>Does any of this matter? This depends on your application! Admittedly, we're
deep in the weeds here, trying to shave off sub-milliseconds from fully lexing
a large input file. If you care about performance at this level of granularity,
it's very likely that you'll consider the full lifecycle of your application
and will have the GC tuned already.</p>
<p>As we've seen with the stark performance improvements from older versions of Go,
the GC has improved a lot. And it keeps improving! Right now an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/48409-soft-memory-limit.md">accepted
proposal</a>
aims to add more control for users with a new <tt class="docutils literal">GOMEMLIMIT</tt> var. This is
likely to land in the next Go version (or the one after it).</p>
<p>A longer term proposal to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/51317">add arenas to Go</a> is also on the table. This
permits much finer-grained memory control, and is particularly suited for
programs like compilers or other users of lexical analysis. Such programs have a
lifecycle that's very suitable for arenas - you allocate a bunch of data per
phase, and then at the very end you release <em>everything</em> in one step.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This post discussed some potential optimizations to a lexical scanner written
in Go. It touched upon the relative efficiency of converting byte slices to
strings vs. taking substrings, discussed some strategies w.r.t. API design
in Go, and even got into optimizing GC behavior.</p>
<p>I'm pleasantly surprised at how fast lexical scanning in Go is. Even the copying
version without GC tuning takes 9.6 ms to process 1 MiB of input source - that's
over 100 MiB /sec! Depending on where your source is stored, this could be
almost as fast as, or faster than your CPU can <em>read</em> the source into memory.
With API changes and GC tuning we were able to improve this by a further 37% to
6 ms, though the specifics here depend on your actual application. Compared to
our original version compiled with Go 1.2, the new lexer is more than 3 times
as fast!</p>
<p><strong>Update (2022-05-24)</strong>: The in-development version of Go (1.19) runs this
benchmark even faster at 5.6 ms (with <tt class="docutils literal">GOGC=1600</tt>)! Go 1.19 should be released
in August.</p>
<p><strong>Update (2023-06-02)</strong>: Today's in-development version of Go (1.21) runs this
benchmark in 4.5 ms (with <tt class="docutils literal">GOGC=1600</tt>)! Go 1.21 should be released in August
2023, but you can try it today with
<a class="reference external" href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/dl/gotip">gotip</a>.</p>
