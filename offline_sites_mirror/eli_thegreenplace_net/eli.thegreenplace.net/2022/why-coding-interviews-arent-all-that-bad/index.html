                <p>Coding interviews have never been popular in the programming community; I mean,
they are prevalent, since many companies still use them to filter
candidates, but they are vastly unpopular <em>in the community</em> because people find
them too hard, too unfair, too unrepresentative of reality and so on. There are
viral stories all around - like when the creator of Homebrew <a class="reference external" href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-logic-behind-Google-rejecting-Max-Howell-the-author-of-Homebrew-for-not-being-able-to-invert-a-binary-tree/answer/Max-Howell?share=100e0bb6&amp;srid=unBJ9">failed Google's
interviews</a>
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>In this post I want to make the case that coding interviews aren't all that bad.
They're certainly not a perfect way to filter candidates to SWE positions, but
they are among the best tools we've got. I've been interviewing folks for SWE
positions for almost 20 years now, and I regularly review hiring packets in
which all of the candidate's interviews are laid out with their results and
recommendations.</p>
<p>First, what do I mean by &quot;coding interviews&quot;? Typically, writing some moderate
amount of code (in the order of 50 lines) throughout the interview, involving
nothing more than simple and fundamental data structures. Linked lists, graphs,
arrays, binary search trees at most. Many interviews will also examine one or
more horizontal aspects like recursion, parsing simple data, and discussing the
runtime and storage complexity and performance of simple algorithms.</p>
<img alt="Example of binary tree inversion, taken from educative.io" class="align-center" src="../../images/2022/invert-binary-tree.png" />
<p>To reiterate, the best coding interviews are relatively <em>simple</em> questions that
don't require deep familiarity with advanced data structres like skip-lists or
quad-trees, but <em>do</em> require a good understanding of programming fundamentals. I
don't ask candidates to <a class="reference external" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/">invert binary trees</a>, but whoever does ask
this question most likely doesn't ask it because it is relevant to their work
projects; rather, they ask it because it probes the candidate's understanding of
recursion, basic data structures, debugging and careful treatment of pointers or
references (depending on the language).</p>
<div class="section" id="objectivity">
<h2>Objectivity</h2>
<p>The reason I prefer asking coding questions is because I firmly believe they
are the most <strong>objective</strong> way to evaluate candidates. Solving a coding question
removes <em>so many</em> subjective factors, especially related to the candidate's
demographics and background, and the majority of the common
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.groupmgmt.com/blog/post/seven-common-interview-biases/">interview biases</a>.</p>
<img alt="Different interview biases" class="align-center" src="../../images/2022/interview-biases.png" />
<p>A good way to think about this is to consider one of the alternatives commonly
proposed to coding interviews: just <em>talk</em> to the candidate, ask about their
background, their past job, the problems they were solving, etc. I actually have
an educational story related to this, from my own experience.</p>
<p>Many years ago in a company far away, I was just starting to interview full-time
candidates (before that I only had experience interviewing interns). In that
company, we would do 90-minute interviews in pairs, and I was
paired with an experienced engineer. The candidate was <em>amazing</em> at talking
about themselves and after 20 minutes I was convinced they should be accepted;
my experienced partner, however, calmly proceeded to asking a relatively simple
technical question (this was a HW design interview and the question had to do
with designing a basic low-pass filter). The candidate was immediately lost
and fumbled for an hour. I remember feeling shocked; how is it possible that
someone <em>obviously so good</em> can't do something so basic?</p>
<p>I keep encountering a variation of this scenario all the time, to this day, but
I'm rarely surprised any more. I learned that just talking to candidates is
a sure way to get an extremely biased view of their skills. I do think that in
a slate of 4-5 interviews it's important for one of them to be more personal
where the interviewer gets to know the candidate and tries to assess if they
are pleasant to work with. But the majority of the interviews have to objective
and technical, IMO.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="take-home-projects">
<h2>Take-home projects</h2>
<p>Another commonly mentioned alternative to coding interviews is <em>take-home
projects</em>, where the candidates get a sizable assignment to complete at home;
this assignment can take on the order of 2-20 hours and is meant to evaluate
the candidate on a much more realistic project than a 45-min coding interview.</p>
<p>There are at least three major challenges with this approach.</p>
<p>First of all, candidates don't like these - since they may take a long time to
finish, and this doesn't scale well when you're applying to multiple jobs. Many
strong candidates will be put off by the requirement to spend multiple hours on
a programming assignment; since finding strong candidates is one of the biggest
challenges companies face, this is an important factor.</p>
<p>Second, these assignments are a burden on the hiring team as well, since they
take a long time to prepare and evaluate. While this may not be a problem for
&quot;one off&quot; hiring quests, anyone who's familiar with the plight of SWEs who
have to spend lots of time on interviews and hiring while also doing their
daily jobs because the company is in a growth spurt, will recognize this issue.</p>
<p>Third and most important - these assignments are very vulnerable to cheating,
and cheating is <em>absolutely rampant</em> in the industry. These days it's easy to
encounter cheating even on mainstream, open platforms <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220219014945/https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/svyem0/go_app_in_gcp_cloud_function_using_terraform/">like Reddit</a>,
not to mention dedicated services like LeetCode or &quot;code for hire&quot; services
where candidates can buy solutions for money. This isn't a new problem, either.
When I was <a class="reference external" href="../../2007/07/14/more-about-my-rentacoder-experiment.html">toying with RentACoder 15 years ago</a>
the majority of projects I ended up doing were either homework or &quot;do my work
for me&quot; assignments.</p>
<p>Now, coding questions are vulnerable to a kind of &quot;cheating&quot; as well - for
example, you can probably find 95% of the questions Google asks on LeetCode
these days, but this is very different IMHO. Sure, you can engorge yourself by
reading hundreds of questions &amp; answers on LeetCode, and come to the interview
ready. But in my experience, when you're faced with an interview you're still on
your own and the interviewer can typically ask tangential questions that will
expose someone who just memorized the answers. Enforcement is much harder
with take-home exercises.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="diversity">
<h2>Diversity</h2>
<p>Lately I've seen a lot of discussion about how the way interviews are currently
done is bad for diversity. The issue of diversity is very important for the
industry, for sure. I agree that companies should be seeking ways to diversify
their work force - and how to do this properly is a genuinely hard question that
is an active area of academic research.</p>
<p>That said, IMHO coding interviews are a significantly <em>more</em>
objective way to evaluate candidates from the diversity standpoint.
The &quot;tell me about yourself&quot; style of interviews is extremely subjective and
open to bias. What better way to activate the automatic rapport people feel
for someone with background similar to theirs, and the ingrained lizard-brain
antagonism to anyone different?</p>
<p>&quot;Take-home projects&quot; are much more subjective too, because guess what - the
cheating is much more available for someone with the money already. As <a class="reference external" href="https://stanforddaily.com/2021/03/18/former-sailing-coach-implicates-athletics-director-in-college-admissions-scandal/">recent
exposés</a>
demonstrate, when important life-long goals are in play, people will do whatever
in their power to get ahead. Folks from a poor background looking for their
first high-paying job will not be in a position to pop a $1,000 for some
off-shore programmer to solve their take-home question, but someone else would.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully this post clarifies why I think that coding interviews, while not
perfect, are an important objective evaluation technique for hiring SWEs. I'm
not saying that coding interviews should be the only criterion, only that they
are an important signal that should not be dropped from any hiring process.</p>
<p>To paraphrase a well-worn <a class="reference external" href="https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/quotes/the-worst-form-of-government/">Churchill quote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Indeed it has been said that a coding interview is the worst form of
interview except for all those other forms that have been tried from
time to time</blockquote>
<p>All of this is IMHO, of course, and I only speak for myself here.</p>
<p><strong>Update (2022-03-29)</strong>: shortly after this post went out, MIT published an
<a class="reference external" href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/we-are-reinstating-our-sat-act-requirement-for-future-admissions-cycles/">article on reinstating standardized scores</a>
(SAT/ACT) as <em>one of criteria</em> for admission. I think it's a very well-written,
evidence-driven and thoughtful article. They explicitly state that such tests,
while not perfect, provide a more objective criteria for under-represented
groups' admissions than other criteria in use. They also provide evidence on how
these tests are predictive of students' success in MIT. I found it to be a very
nice parallel for this post.</p>

extremely low, and the vast majority of these candidates will easily
solve typical coding questions. The remaining probability of <tt class="docutils literal">P(fail |
