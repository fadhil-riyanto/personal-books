For me, "The great Gatsby" is most of all a proof that a great story can be both
short and simple. 

<p>Nick, the narrator, tells about his neighbor, Gatsby - a
very rich guy that is first presented as a mysterious organizer of massive
parties. This mystery is, however, quickly resoved as it becomes clear that he
does it in order to find a girl he loves. This brings me to an important point
about this book - all mysteries are eventually resolved, everything is very
clear, and (once again) simple. The reading just "flows through" the plot
without stopping.</p><p>

It is an entertaining account of the lives of rich people in the gay 20s in the
United States. I'm not familiar with that era, but it seems that the people were
generally prosperous in the pre-1929-crisis years. Technological advances start
to creep into their lives - telephones, cars, various machines. The rich, young
people seem careless and fun seeking - parties, private parties, cars, movies,
more parties...</p><p>

The superficiality of the relations between married couples is also shown. Tom
cheats on Daisy without much effort to conceal it. His mistress also cheats on
her husband in a pretty explicit way (Tom comes to their house often and
secretly offers her to meet at places). It's funny how Tom fights for Daisy in
the end, even though he knows she has feelings for another man.</p><p>

The story of Mrs. Wilson's death is humorously intertwined, in my opinion. A
whole series of random events brings to her death, and it's not even obvious who
is responsible.</p><p>

There's also some tragedy, I think. Gatsby's love for Daisy is tragic, he is
"stuck in the past" and pays for it eventually.
</p>
<p>On my "best books of the 19-20the centuries" reading list, this one appears
in the top 5. I wasn't dissapointed, though I can't say it's one of my most
favorites. It's a very good novel, magic in some ways - a well recommended
read.</p>
