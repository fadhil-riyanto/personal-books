        Writing code for embedded systems calls for a whole different
set of techniques, with which most of "normal" application programmers
are not familiar. This book was written to introduce C and C++ programmers
to the embedded world - programming for small devices on special boards,
rather than for PCs and servers.<p>
A book like this can be judged at two levels - how useful it is to
beginners and how useful it is to people that have some experience with
embedded programming.</p><p>
I personally belong to the 2nd category - I'm working in embedded
development for about a year now, not much experience by any set of
standards (especially taking into account that I did mostly hardware,
not software), but I already felt that this book didn't provide me
with almost any new information. So I guess that for people a bit more
experienced than I am it will be totally useless (something like reading
an introductory "dummies" or "12 days" C book for expert C coders).</p><p>
As for the beginners category, I cannot evaluate the book objectively (since
I'm not a beginner), but I can guess that it would be useful. The author's
style is light and not heavy on technical details. However, I feel that the
author assumes *some* familiarity with the embedded world, though I wouldn't
know, as I get this feeling any time I go over a beginners' book on a subject
I know.</p><p>
What this book did give me is a feeling of how things I wanted to do and
considered cool are not hard to achieve. As I mentioned in previous posts,
embedded programming interests me a lot. I even considered buying a test
board that connects to a PC and write code for it. The book goes over this,
proposing a test board with an Intel 8051 processor, and explains how to
bang C/C++ code that makes the board tick.</p><p>
Another nice thing is a chapter about operating systems. The author codes
a small and simple multi-tasking operating system, with context switches
and all. It's pity that he didn't include his ASM code in the book and
explained it as well (he refers to a website for the code).</p><p>
All in all, this book would be nice for beginners (again, it's only a guess),
but for people that have their hands already wet in some embedded development
it wouldn't be of much value.</p>
