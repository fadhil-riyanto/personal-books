<p>
I was convinced to read this book after a long time since I saw how popular it
has become. I had a feeling that I won't learn much from it, and I guess I can
say I was right.
</p><p>
The book's main part is a story about 4 imaginary creatures
in an imaginary world, creatures that handle "changes" differently. The goal is
to convince the reader that "moving on" is the best way to handle change.
</p><p>
This is explained during one of the characters' quest to understand change and
find ways to handle it effectively, in contrast to another character that
refuses to accept change (which represents most people, I guess) and suffers as
a result of that. The character that does handle change keeps "points to think
about" that should summarize the book's main theme.
</p><p>
As I wrote here
before, I'm a big fan of Carnegie and have read his "How to stop worrying"
twice. I try to live by the rules I've set to myself after reading his books, so
maybe this is the reason "Who moved my cheese" seemed pretty shallow to me.
Maybe it's just one of Carnegie's lessons "for dummies".
</p><p>
But I still recommend everyone to read it, because it's very short (less than a
hour reading) and you may gain something from it, so what the heck, you can just
try. The chances that your view on life will change are slim, but the investment
is small, so it's worth it.
</p><p>
P.S: Why aren't the "mice" creatures given
more focus ? They have maybe 5 and a half sentences written about them. If they
are 2 of the "types of people", why not elaborate on them a little more, why
give all the attention to the other two types ?
