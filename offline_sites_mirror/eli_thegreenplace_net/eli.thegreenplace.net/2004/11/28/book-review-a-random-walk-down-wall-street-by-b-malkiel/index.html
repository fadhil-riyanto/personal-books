I ordered this book after reading Joel's positive review (<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/</a>). The review ends with:
<p>
What if I told you that you could read one book and know everything you are
going to need to know about managing your investments? And I mean, everything.
Well, it's true. And this is the book. If you can't be bothered to read anything
else about investing, read this one book.
 </p><p>
Well, I heartily agree. This is probably the best finance/economics book I've
ever read.
</p><p>
Burton Malkiel takes a simple, logical approach, with intuitive mathematical
expositions, statistical studies and numerous examples to explain his view of
the investment practices on the stock market. He analyzes fundamental and
technical analysis and points out their flaws (loaded with historical studies
that prove his point). Then, he presents the random walk theory (efficient
markets) and takes a position as its proponent to some degree. The book
concludes with a guide to investment taken from his own experience.
</p><p>
There's something very charming in the methodical, determined approach of this
book. Malkiel takes no prisoners with the techniques he criticizes. He presents
studies, both academic and by financial institutions, simulations, discusses
some economics related maths and presents historic evidence to prove his points.
</p><p> I'm not sure I agree with Joel on the "only one" part of the review. I'm
glad I've read some investments books before this one, so I can fully grasp
Malkiel's criticism. I can especially relate to the attack on technical
analysis. As I wrote in previous reviews, this technique of investment analysis
seems somewhere from unreal to ridiculous to me, and reading this book just made
this opinion stronger. It's very amusing to read about some of the
occasionally-popping technical analysis gurus, about running computer
simulations with historical data that shatter all the technical "signs" and
about random simulations that contain "head and shoulders", "triple bottoms",
etc.</p><p> The investment plan offered in this book is probably the most
logical and down-to-earth one I've read about. To conclude, go get this book,
it's a terrific review of where you should and shouldn't invest money.</p>
