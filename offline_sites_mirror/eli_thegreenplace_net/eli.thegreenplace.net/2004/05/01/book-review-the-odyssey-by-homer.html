First, a note: I printed this book for myself from "The Literature Network"
(directory of legal books for download)... reading on A4 is possible, it's not
as bad as I thought.<p> Well, this is definitely a classic book. Written more
than 2000 years ago, it is considered one of the greatest "epics" of all times.
I can agree only partly.</p><p> On one hand, the story line is quite good. A
quest of Odysseus to return home after 20 years of wandering. Troubles at home -
people want someone else to marry his wife and his household can't live a normal
life. After many challenges along the way he manages, with some help from the
gods, to come home, kill all the offenders and reunite with his family - happy
happy joy joy.</p><p> For me, the interesting part of this plot is the
involvement of gods (other than that, it's a fairy tale, and I've read heaps of
those when I was a kid) in the lives of the people. It seems to me that the gods
manipulated mortals for pleasure. Like the ancient version of "Young and
restless", etc. The gods must have been a pretty bored bunch up on their Olympus
mountain, so for a bit of entertainment they played with the people's mind,
devising wars, peaces, marriages, separations, and generally whatever they
wanted. The book is quite violent - not much thought is applied to the value of
human lives. For instance, I'm not sure it was absolutely necessary to slaughter
all the "wooers" in the end. This reminds me of the same violence that appears
in the Bible, where people of different religions slaughter each other without
any pity (hmm... that sounds scarily familiar).
</p><p>
On the other hand, the writing style is very, very heavy. It's definitely the
book with the most ancient style I've ever read. "Thou", "Thy", "Thee",
"Hearken", "Spake", "Avow", "Didst", "Therewith", etc. I know what these words
mean, it's just the first time I actually saw them used so much.</p><p> The
dialogs are sometimes boring and "off the point". But the style is very
different from modern: "And then X spake"..."And then Y answered"..."And then X
spake"... Nowadays this is implicit.</p><p> The titles are very amusing. I'd
like to hear sometimes: "And then the steadfast goodly Eli of many counsels
spake winged words unto her"... LOL :-)</p><p> All in all, it's been interesting
to read a Greek epic. I really like the Greek mythology, and this was a "wet
excercise" - reading a novel that actually involves mythology and where
everything is put to its places. The style is heavy, but there's no other way
out, I guess. They spake (hehe...) this way back then, and the translation tries
to reproduce it as accurately as possible.</p>
