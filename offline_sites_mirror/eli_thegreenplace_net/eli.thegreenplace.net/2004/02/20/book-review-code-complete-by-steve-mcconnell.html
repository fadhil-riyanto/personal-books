<p>
This is, no less, an encyclopedia of "programming practices". Everything you
think of when you ponder about programming and software engineering (bar a
specific programming language/environment) can be found in this 800-page book,
explained in detail.
</p><p>

Being encyclopedic in nature, "Code complete" is very hard to read
cover-to-cover quickly. So, I just put it at work and read a chapter here and
there when I got the free time. It took me more than a year to complete it, and
meanwhile the 2nd edition was released. Note that this review refers to the
first edition.
</p><p>

The scope of this book is overwhelming. Everything is carefully chewed, starting
with low-level stuff of how to write loops, name variables, and use white-space,
and up until high-level software architecture and design, QA, system integration
and even philosophic ventures into the topics of personal character and
"software craftsmanship" and their relation to programming. The detail McConnell
gets into is sometimes astonishing. For example, 12 pages are devoted to correct
programming of <i>if</i> and <i>case</i> statements, and there are 30 pages on
naming (variables, data types, etc.)
</p><p>
 
I didn't learn much new from this book. This is both surprising, encouraging and
dissapointing. 
</p><p>

It's surprising because the book is so large and vast, and contains (literally!)
loads of information. It was written about 10 years ago, and it appears that
since then these ideas sunk well in the software community and became
common-sense. That's probably why most of what I've read sounded familiar - I
usually try to keep up with software practices and professional books.
</p><p>

It's encouraging because I now know that I have all this information somewhere
in my head. I can't be sure I always use it correctly, but that is another
issue. Having the information in my head is a good prerequisite to being a
better programmer, I hope.
</p><p>

It's dissapointing because... well, because I bought the book and spent a lot of
time reading it. I think that I'm quite happy overall, since the "encouraging"
part overweights the "dissapointing".
</p><p>

If you're an experienced programmer and have read a couple of similar
books/articles, I don't think you'll gain much from this book. Maybe a couple of
specific chapters here and there, but there's no need to read it cover to cover.
If these topics are new to you, then the book is a must. Each serious programmer
should read about these topics at least once in his lifetime, and later come
back to specific details when needed. In any case, don't spend money buying it,
as the draft of the 2nd edition is available online.
</p><p>

By the way, I think this book would be a great basis for a course (or two) in
Uni. Collecting the most important points and teaching them, along with proper
excercises, to students that have just completed a few basic CS/programming
courses would be great. There are software engineering courses in Uni, but they
focus only on the high-level issues, while this book covers the whole scope of
the trade.
