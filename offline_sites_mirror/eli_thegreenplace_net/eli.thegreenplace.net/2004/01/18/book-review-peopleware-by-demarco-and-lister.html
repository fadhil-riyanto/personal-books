<p>
"Peopleware: Productive projects and teams" seems to be the cult book on
software management. So, after reading and hearing many favorable reviews I've
decided to read it.
</p><p>

The book talks about a very familiar subject, but from an unfamiliar angle. The
issue of programmer's work quality - what affects it and how to improve it, is a
well-chewed topic in software engineering books. Peopleware takes a differenct
side, and looks at this topic from the perspective of programmer managers and
not programmers themselves.
</p><p>

The authors have many useful insights on the subjects of office environment
(probably the most thorough treatment of this subject I've ever read), "jelling
teams together", picking the right people and making work fun. I found that the
8th chapter - "You never get anything done around here between 9 and 5" has
especially struck a cord with me - it was a sheer pleasure to read and to agree
with.
</p><p>

On the bad side, I think the book re-chews certain subjects too much. Maybe an
experienced manager would understand the fine distinctions, but not a mere
code-monkey like me. I've read the 2nd edition, which has extra 8 chapters in
the end, and found them almost completely repeating the other contents of the
book. I guess the desire to earn extra money on a 2nd edition are greater than
the desire to keep the book more complete and non-repeating. Also, one could not
help to wonder - if these guys (Lister and DeMarco) are so smart, how come
they're not big-shot managers in big firms ? They work as consultants for many
years, but what is exactly the role of a consultant in this business ? Just go
around firms and tell managers how they better manage ? As they say, those who
can work - work. Those who can't - teach. (and those who can't teach - teach
sports, but that's another issue).
</p><p>

All in all, I enjoyed most parts of the book. I don't think it's necessary for
non-managers to read it, while managers could benefit from it. Sadly, although
many things said in the book are true, they're not always easy to implement, so
people just complain about these things but they eventually stay the same. I'd
really like to work under a manager who not only read "Peopleware", and not only
agreed with it, but also implemented at least some of the advices stated there
in his team.
