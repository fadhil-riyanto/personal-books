        At first sight, this one is in a category of books I try not to read much. I know they're very readable, I know time flows quickly when you read them, and the head shouldn't work too hard. I also know I forger what they were about soon after finishing them.<p>
But this is only at first sight. Actually, while "The Wedding" has most of the features I presented above, I will certainly remember it. When the easy-going fast style combines with pieces of knowledge, or generally things that make you think, what you get is a truly excellent book.
</p><p>
"The Wedding" tells the story of a couple in their fifties, a very "typical" couple. A house in a quiet small town, three successful children who've already "left the nest", the husband (Wilson) works as a
partner in a lawyer firm, the wife (Jane) raised the children and now enjoys a quiet life at home.
</p><p>
And, as is probably common, their relationship slowly deteriorates - not in a sense they fight, they don't. Rather, they just take each other for granted, behaving more like good old friends than like a couple.
</p><p>
So, the story is Wilson's quest to regain the love of his wife, which, in his opinion, he lost by being very un-romantic (climaxing in his forgetting their 29th anniversary). Telling more is a spoiler, so just get the book and read it.
</p><p>
Frankly, I really liked the story. Wilson's endeavor to fix his marriage is very touching. Even though I'm married for less than two years and we don't even have children yet, I can somehow relate to Wilson's feelings. I think that people in their 40s and 50s should really get this book and read it ASAP, as it may give them very vital food for thought. When you take someone or something for granted, it's very hard to notice (stemming from the nature of the problem :-), so it's good to have some talk/read to "open your eyes".</p><p>
I think that married person should read this book. Go figure, it might just make your life better, and a few hours of light enjoyable reading are not too much to pay for such an opportunity.</p>
