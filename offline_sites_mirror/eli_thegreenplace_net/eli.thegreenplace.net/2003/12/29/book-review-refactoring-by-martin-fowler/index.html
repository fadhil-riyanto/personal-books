"Refactoring: Improving the design of existing code" by Martin Fowler, Kent
Beck, John Brant, William Opdyke and Dan Roberts.
</p><p>

This book serves both as a tutorial and a reference. It's a tutorial on the
topic of "refactoring" - changing existing code for the sake of better
design/code, without affecting its external behavior. It's also a reference of
this subject, more than half the book being a catalog of "refactorings" - common
ways to modify code to make it better/simple/more robust. It somewhat resembles
"Design patterns" presenting techniques in a dictionary-like matter.
</p><p>

I only skimmed through the reference part, as one should do on the first reading
(it's mostly for later, if you want to apply some refactoring to your code and
want some guidance), but I read the tutorial part thoroughly, and really enjoyed
it.
</p><p>

It appears that one of my philosophies in programming is, in fact, refactoring.
Taking working code and applying changes to it only for the sake of making it
better code (without any visible change to the user/customer) is something I do
a lot, both to my code and to code of others. It is, IMHO, the best way to
program, and it's reassuring to know that a whole book was written on the
subject by experienced programmers.
</p><p>

Refactoring is a way to assure that "it's okay not to be perfect". When people
design something, say, a computer program, they will do their best to design it
correctly from the start, but this doesn't always work out. In fact, with
requirements changing and deadlines pushing, it mostly doesn't work out from the
first time. But should it ? Should we expect perfection right away? This is
un-human and unnatural for a design process. Refactoring allows us to reassess
an existing design, gradually improving upon it as changes come on the way. It
is a far more natural way to design. Make your best, but know that there is
place for improvement later. This way, you aren't afraid to change, to improve,
which is very important. Design conducted this way will always stay up to date,
fitting best its current requirements. I don't want to go too far idealizing,
because ideals don't exist, but refactoring helps us to somewhat approximate
them.
</p><p>

I liked many things in the book, but especially enjoyed the part on automatic
testing. It is a very important factor in refactoring and in programming as a
whole.
</p><p>

A programmer likes to be confident about the changes he applies, especially to
complex unknown code. Small tests that can be always run to verify correctness
can really save a few gray hairs :-)
</p><p>

By all means, read this book if you're into serious programming.
