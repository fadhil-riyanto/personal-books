        I got to this book from a post on the "Lambda weblog", that mentioned that Mr. Gabriel released it for free in a soft-copy.<p>
On one hand, it took me 2.5 days to finish it, which says something, on the other hand, I'm not sure how much it really measured against my expectations for it.</p><p>
The name is a little misleading - out of 240 pages, Gabriel talks about patterns in only 90 or so. The secondary title - "tales from the software community" also takes only about 1/3 of the book.</p><p>
The book is a collection of articles and essays Gabriel wrote, and it feels like just a lump of stuff he thought of and wanted to share with the world. Which is nice, as the writer is an authority in the Lisp and OOP worlds, and is a great writer - his style is excellent: interesting and very readable.</p><p>
Gabriel tells about "patterns" in a very general term, as developed by the architect Alexander. He applies these patters to software, though in many places his metaphores are unclear and too far-fetched (he writes poems, after all). Then, he proceeds to tell a little about the history of programming languages, which is a mixture of historic and philosophic conjurings, and is quite educating. Gabriel clearly has a great understanding of the topic, he's been there for a long time.</p><p>
Gabriel proceeds with a couple of essays on writing, which are very interesting if you're interesting in writing. I am, so I've read these essays eagerly - they're well written, which is appropriate. He asserts that developers must learn the art of writing and do it well, and I agree with this entirely !</p><p>
Then, the "tales from the software community" part. It's the less technical, 90% biographical, and the most readable part of the book. The author tells about his bio from high school, through the universities of Northeastern, MIT, Illinois and eventually Stanford, where he got a (little controvercial, and not entirely successful) PhD. Gabriel is not ashame of describing his failures (many of them) and feelings, which is inspiring. </p><p>
After his academical part, he proceeds to start a company, named Lucid (I still wonder if the Lucid Emacs modules have anything to do with it). The company first rides on the wave of Lisp, trying to build a portable implementation, and then rides on the wave of C++, trying to build a complete and a little Lisp-like environment to the then-popular language. This is an interesting account of a technological start-up, from its inception and until its death.</p><p>
Overall, I liked the book, but I'm glad I haven't paid money for it. It's the kind of books you read in a couple of days, get a little inspiration and thinking-material, and never come back to later. But the book is generally good, and as it is available for free (in a nicely formatted PDF), go on and read it.</p>
