<p>
Milewski draws a lot of experience from his work at Microsoft, and this book is
to tell us about it. It's one of the most unusual kinds of programming books,
one that I've wanted to read for a long time. It's massively "hands-on", which
is a great thing (especially after introductory books get boring and reference
books are... well... just reference books).
</p><p>
"C++ in action" starts with an overview of C++. This is not your usual overview,
and people fresh to programming will have a very hard time grokking it. It takes
the same "hands-on" approach, introducing C++ features "on a need-to-know
basis".
</p><p>
Next the real fun begins. The author undertakes a real
programming project - with a spec and everything. It's a calculator, that
understands generalized expressions with rec-descent parsing (i.e. x = y * (z *
sin(2*pi)) is understood), saves variables, functions, etc... definitely not a
trivial task.
</p><p>
An implementation is introduced chapter after
chapter.
</p><p>
The next part is the best. The author questions the quality of
the code written for the calculator, and takes on a task to improve it.
Redesign, refactoring, exception safety (with interesting allocation schemes to
keep it exception-robust), containers, auto-pointers, containers for
auto-pointers, smart (ref-count) pointers, containers for them, STL is
introduced. All of this is again introduced on a "need to know" basis. The
author says "wouldn't it be nice to have X", and then X is either coded or build
from existing C++ features. This part is great. I felt that I'm swiftly taken on
a whole new, high level of C++ programming.
</p><p>
The last part is general
about software engineering, not much different from other books on the topic, so
it's not a highlight in this book.
</p><p>
Now to some negative points: the
examples in the book, and especially the code, is not "polished" enough. Some
code is missing, there are some mistakes, which all makes "reading and typing in
the examples"  a very daunting task. Without these problems, the book could be
rated "excellent" for sure.
</p><p>
Conclusion: if you are a beginning C++
programmer, with some early knowledge of C++, and want to see what "industrial
strengh" C++ looks like, while being led through a real and interesting example,
and have some patience for the mistakes, definitely download the book and work
through it. There's no doubt that it will raise your level of C++ to new
heights.</p>
