      <p>
Well, yesterday I implemented the "#include" capability. It was actually very
fun and instructive - it made me recall the "prepare to throw one away" phrase
from "Mythical man month". Let me elaborate:
      </p><p>
      I had a gut feeling that there should be some simple, "enlightened"
      recursive solution for "#include", but nothing came to my head. So I
      intentionally started coding a prototype. It resulted in 2 functions, with
      quite a lot of duplicated code, but it worked. Using the experience from
      this prototype, I coded a single function, that was shorter than each of
      the previous ones and did all the job, in that "enlightened recursive"
      kind of way. Nice ! Indeed, sometimes it's best to code a working
prototype to understand how things work. Note taken.</p>
      
      <p> Then I started
implementing the "#define...#ifdef..." family. Oh goodness... this is
complicated, and I see no "enlightened" way to code it. I didn't finish, will
take on it now again, hopefully I'll be over this until the evening. Here comes
some rant:</p>
      
      <p> Sometimes, it's just impossible to create a simple solution to
something. The specs are so complicated with so many special cases and things
that should go this and that way... I'm willing to challenge anyone, to code a
CLEAN implementation of the #define...#ifdef...#else, etc. capability of the
c-preprocessor. CLEAN means without tons of flags, and generally code that
"looks right" rather than "tailored to somehow solve the problem".</p>
      
      <p> I
don't feel too bad about it though. It's because I've seen (and even modified)
the code of two other, popular implementations of cpp:
</p>

<p><ul>
<li>One from Decus, that ran on many IBM platforms: ugly spaghetti, written in old, K&amp;R style C. Dozens of "goto"s and "break flags". Files named cpp1.c, cpp2.c ... cpp6.c (hail modularity !).</li>
<li>Another from GNU itself. The cpp of gcc 2.96. To say it's much better than the one from Decus is a big lie. They implement a lame parser of C, with highly unstructured code, huge "switches" with a lot of flags.</li> </ul>
Also, people can sing praises to OOP, functional-programming and stuff like
that, but nothing will help here. No implementation of this can be really clean,
which is very unfortunate :-(
</p>
<p> Enough rant for today, back to work...</p>
