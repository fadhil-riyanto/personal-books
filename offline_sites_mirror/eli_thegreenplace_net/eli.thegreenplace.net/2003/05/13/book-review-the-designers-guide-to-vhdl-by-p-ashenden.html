        <p>I used VHDL on a beginner's level a couple of years ago. Now, when I
        have to work with it a lot on a high level, it was obvious that I need a
        VHDL refresher.
<p>
I was immmediately handed the ubiquitous (as it seems) "VHDL" by D. Perry. That
book is BAD, BAD, BAD. Not only you can't <i>really</i> learn from it, but it is
also a poor reference. </p>
<p>
Seeking for other solutions I took "The designer's guide to VHDL" from a
collegue. After a couple of days of skimming through the book and trying some
examples, I was convinced it is the guide & reference I was looking for. I
continued reading, diving into more and more advanced topics and my opinion only
got better - the book is very comprehensive, also being light-style and
understandable. The topics are organized logically (unlike in Perry's book), and
the index is terrific - finding topics is easy and painless. What's very
important is that the book discusses design methodologies, common techniques
used by the experts and (very important) testing. It has a few fully-developed
test-cases that together cover high-level design very well. If you follow the
whole book closely, you can eventually build its main case-study - the DLX
processor from the monumental "Computer architecture - a quantitative
approach".</p>
<p>
This is definitely the book to get if you have to write designs in VHDL. I
ordered it and should have my own copy on the desk in a couple of weeks (company
bureaucracy). Can't wait for it...</p>
