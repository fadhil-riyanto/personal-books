                <p>My <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/llvm-clang-samples">llvm-clang-samples</a>
repository has been public for over a year, and has become quite popular
recently. I figured it's about time I write a quick blog post explaining how it
came to be and what the principles behind it are.</p>
<p>One on the biggest selling points of LLVM and Clang is that they're packaged as
libraries with a rich C++ API (and also C APIs), and thus can be easily embedded
in larger applications. However, if you look online for samples of making this
embedding happen, you'll start noticing two fairly big problems with most of the
code you find:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>All official LLVM tutorials (and many of the samples online) talk about
building your project <em>inside</em> the LLVM tree, using LLVM's own build system.
Actually, LLVM has two official build systems (one based on autotools and
another on CMake), so the samples will be further fragmented between these.
While building within the LLVM tree if fine for experimenting, it won't work
if you want to integrate LLVM as a library into a parent project.</li>
<li>LLVM's and Clang's C++ API is changing constantly; C++ API stability is not a
design goal of the LLVM community (one could argue that <em>instability</em> is a
design goal). Therefore, if you find some code a few months after it was
posted online, there's a very good chance that it won't compile or run. Code
from a couple of years ago? Forget about it.</li>
</ol>
<p>A few years ago, when I was getting started with LLVM, I was also frustrated by
these problems. So I rolled my sleeves and banged out a simple Makefile that
made it possible to build a few samples out of the LLVM tree, and then
industriously kept it up to date with LLVM and Clang changes. I had it in my
private code coffers for a while, but last year figured it could be useful to
others, so I published it in a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/llvm-clang-samples">public GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm-clang-samples</span></tt> is very simple - it's just a bunch of
self-contained programs using LLVM or Clang as libraries, centered around the
<tt class="docutils literal">Makefile</tt>, which dictates how to build these programs vs. a built version of
LLVM &amp; Clang itself. I chose a Makefile since it's the lowest common denominator
of build systems - my Makefile is purposefully very simple and linear - think of
it as a shell script with some automatic dependency management thrown in.</p>
<p>With simple configuration, this Makefile can build programs vs. either a built
source checkout of LLVM, or released binaries (so compiling LLVM itself is not
really required). There's also a suite of tests I run to make sure that the
samples are not only built correctly, but also run correctly and keep producing
expected results.</p>
<p>The samples themselves cover a wide range of LLVM &amp; Clang uses. There are
standalone programs using LLVM as a library to process LLVM IR. There's a sample
of building a dynamically-linked pass that can be loaded as a plugin with
<tt class="docutils literal">opt</tt>. There are samples of <a class="reference external" href="../05/01/modern-source-to-source-transformation-with-clang-and-libtooling/index.html">Clang tooling</a>,
a Clang plugin, and so on.</p>
<p>How do I keep the repository up-to-date, though? There are two paths. First,
every time there is a new official LLVM release (this happens about twice a
year), I make sure the samples build and work fine with it, and create a new
branch. Forever after, checking this branch out will give you the repository in
a state that works with the relevant released version. This is very useful
because for most users, the bleeding edge is not required and they can do just
fine with the latest released version. Moreover, if there's a need to work with
an even older release, the repository already has <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/llvm-clang-samples/branches">some history</a>, going back to LLVM
3.3 (released in June 2013).</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">master</tt> branch of the repository is kept in sync with LLVM by me
manually, and the &quot;last known good LLVM revision&quot; it works against appears on
the main README file. I usually try to refresh it every week or two. It's very
rare for it to fall more than a few weeks behind. And of course, if you find it
<em>did</em> fall behind, don't hesitate to open an issue (or better yet, create a pull
request) - I usually get to these fairly quickly.</p>
