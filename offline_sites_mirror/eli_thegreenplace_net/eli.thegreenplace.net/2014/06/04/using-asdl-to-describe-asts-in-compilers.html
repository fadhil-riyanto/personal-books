        <p>ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) are an <a class="reference external" href="../../../2009/02/16/abstract-vs-concrete-syntax-trees/index.html">important data structure</a> in compiler front-ends. If you've written a few parsers, you almost definitely ran into the need to describe the result of the parsing in terms of an AST. While the kinds of nodes such ASTs have and their structure is very specific to the source language, many commonalities come up. In other words, coding &quot;yet another AST&quot; gets really old after you've done it a few times.</p>
<p>Worry not, as you'd expect from the programmer crowd, this problem was &quot;solved&quot; by adding another level of abstraction. Yes, an <strong>abstraction</strong> over <strong>Abstract</strong> Syntax Trees, oh my! The abstraction here is some textual format (let's call it a DSL to sound smart) that describes what the AST looks like, along with machinery to auto-generate the code that implements this AST.</p>
<p>Most solutions in this domain are ad-hoc, but one that I've seen used more than once is <a class="reference external" href="http://asdl.sourceforge.net/">ASDL</a> - Abstract Syntax Definition Language. The self-description from the website sounds about right:</p>
<blockquote>
The Zephyr Abstract Syntax Description Lanuguage (ASDL) is a language designed to describe the tree-like data structures in compilers. Its main goal is to provide a method for compiler components written in different languages to interoperate. ASDL makes it easier for applications written in a variety of programming languages to communicate complex recursive data structures.</blockquote>
<p>To give an example, here's a short snippet from an ASDL definition of a simple programming language:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%">program = Program(class* classes)

class = Class(identifier name, identifier? parent, feature* features)

[...]

expression = Assign(identifier name, expression expr)
           | StaticDispatch(expression expr, identifier type_name,
                            identifier name, expression* actual)
           | Dispatch(expression expr, identifier name, expression* actual)

[...]
</pre></div>
<p>The way to read this is: a <em>program</em> node consists of one or more <em>classes</em>. Each <em>class</em> has these children: a <em>name</em> which is an identifier, an optional <em>parent</em> which is also an identifier, and a (potentially empty) list of <em>features</em>, each of which is a feature node. And so on.</p>
<p>The full details are available in the paper &quot;The Zephyr Abstract Syntax Definition Language&quot; by Wang et.al. Unfortunately, a link to this paper isn't always trivial to find, so I have a PDF copy in the <tt class="docutils literal">docs</tt> directory of my <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/asdl_parser">asdl_parser project</a>, which I'm going to discuss soon.</p>
<div class="section" id="type-safety-in-asdl">
<h3>Type safety in ASDL</h3>
<p>In addition to providing a concise description of nodes from which code (in many languages) can be generated automatically, I like ASDL for another reason. It provides some type safety when constructing the AST in the parser.</p>
<p>Take the snippet above, for example. A <em>program</em> has the <em>classes</em> attribute, which is a (potentially empty) sequence of <em>class</em> nodes. Each such class has to be a <em>Class</em>, which is precisely defined. It can be nothing else. The <em>expression</em> below that shows it differently - an expression can be either a <em>Assign</em>, <em>StaticDispatch</em>, etc.</p>
<p>The set of possibilities is statically defined. This makes it possible to insert some degree of static checking into the (auto-generated) AST construction code. So the constructed AST can't be completely bogus even before semantic analysis is applied. Even though I love Python, I do appreciate a bit of static type checking in the right places. Key data structures like ASTs are, I believe, one of the places when such type checking makes sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="asdl-in-upstream-cpython">
<h3>ASDL in upstream CPython</h3>
<p>Starting with Python 2.5, the CPython compiler (the part responsible for emitting bytecode from Python source) uses an ASDL description to create an AST for Python source. The AST is created by the parser (from the parse tree - more details in <a class="reference external" href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0339/">PEP 339</a>), and is then used to create the control-flow graph, from which bytecode is emitted.</p>
<p>The ASDL description lives in <tt class="docutils literal">Parser/Python.asdl</tt> in the CPython source tree. <tt class="docutils literal">Parser/asdl_c.py</tt> is a script that runs whenever someone modifies this ASDL description. It uses the <tt class="docutils literal">Parser/asdl.py</tt> module to parse the ASDL file into an internal form and then emits C code that describes the ASTs. This C code lives in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Include/Python-ast.h</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Python/Python-ast.c</span></tt> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>This may be more details than you wanted to hear :-) The gist of it, however, is - CPython's ASTs are described in ASDL, and if you want a quick glance of how these ASTs look, <tt class="docutils literal">Parser/Python.asdl</tt> is the file to look at.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-rewrite-of-the-asdl-parser">
<h3>My rewrite of the ASDL parser</h3>
<p>Up until very recently, the ASDL description of the CPython AST was parsed by a tool that relied on the <a class="reference external" href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/spark/">SPARK parsing toolkit</a>. In fact, <tt class="docutils literal">Parser/spark.py</tt> was carried around in the distribution just for this purpose.</p>
<p>A few months ago I was looking for something to conveniently implement the AST for a toy compiler I was hacking on. Being a CPython developer, ASDL immediately sprang to mind, but I was reluctant to carry the SPARK dependency and/or learn how to use it. The ASDL language seemed simple enough to not require such machinery. Surely a simple recursive-descent parser would do. So I implemented my own stand-alone parser for ASDL, using modern Python 3.x - and it's available in a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/asdl_parser">public Github repository right here</a>. Feel free to use it, and let me know how it goes!</p>
<p>Since my parser turned out to be much simpler and easier to grok than upstream CPython's SPARK-based parser, I proposed to replace it in <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.python.org/issue19655">Issue 19655</a>. After some delays (caused mainly by waiting for 3.4 release and then getting distracted by other stuff), the change <a class="reference external" href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/b769352e2922">landed in the default branch</a> (on its way to 3.5) about a month ago. The result is pleasing - the new parser is shorter, doesn't require the SPARK dependency (which was now dropped), has tests and is much more maintainable.</p>
<p>In the interest of not changing too much at once, I left the interface to the C code generator (<tt class="docutils literal">Parser/asdl_c.py</tt>) the same, so there is absolutely no difference in the produced C code. Some time in the future it may make sense to revise this decision. The C generator is also fairly old code that could use some modernization and tests.</p>

<div class="section" id="historical-note-ast-description-in-pycparser">
<h3>Historical note - AST description in pycparser</h3>
<p>I first ran into this problem (high-level description of ASTs) when I was working on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/pycparser">pycparser</a> (which is <a class="reference external" href="../../../2008/11/15/pycparser-v10-is-out/index.html">quite an old project</a> by now).</p>
<p>Back at the time, I looked at the <tt class="docutils literal">compiler</tt> module of Python 2.x and liked its approach of simple textual description of the AST which is then parsed and from which the code for AST nodes is emitted. The <tt class="docutils literal">compiler</tt> module was a maintenance headache (because it duplicated a lot of the AST logic from the actual compiler) and is gone in Python 3.x, replaced by the <tt class="docutils literal">ast</tt> module which provides access to the same C-based AST generated by <tt class="docutils literal">Parser/asdl_c.py</tt> as is used by the CPython compiler.</p>
<p>pycparser's AST description is a simple textual file that's very similar in spirit to ASDL. If I were to do this today, I'd probably also pick ASDL since it's more &quot;standard&quot;, as well as for the extra type safety guarantees it provides.</p>
