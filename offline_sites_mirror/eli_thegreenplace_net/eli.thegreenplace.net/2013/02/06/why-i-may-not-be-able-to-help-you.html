<p>
Since this blog features a lot of programming content, I'm receiving quite a bit
of email from people asking for help and advice, either about something specific
I wrote, or just general questions. This isn't new - it's been going on for
years. But my attitude towards this has changed over time. Some years ago, I was
almost always willing to help. It was an opportunity to learn, and I was very
proud that someone I haven't ever met seeks my advice just because I
wrote a blog post about this and that. These days, however, it's getting harder
and harder for me to find the time.
</p>
<p>
You have to realize that the amount of time I have for these things is extremely
small. I have a full-time job I find challenging and interesting, and most of my
off-work time is spent with my family. In the scant weekly hours I have
remaining for "hobby programming", I'm hopelessly oversubscribed with taking
care of my active open-source projects, contributing to Python and writing new
articles.
</p>
<p>
This doesn't mean you should not ask. If the question pertains to a project I
actively maintain, I will certainly answer. The issue tracker for that project
is the best place to ask though, not email. If it's about something I wrote
relatively recently in the blog - there's also a high chance of getting an
answer. If it's something I wrote a while ago, it depends on how much I'm still
interested in the subject, so I may not be able to provide a good answer. In
some extreme cases I may not answer an email at all.
</p>
<p>
The chance of a question getting a good answer also depends on the question. If
it's a short question asking about something very specific, and requiring a
short answer, it has a higher chance of getting a good answer. If you're dumping
a 50-page spec on me asking "how to design this" (this happened so many times it
doesn't even surprise me any longer), then not so much.
</p>
<p>
There's also the issue of consulting. In general, I very rarely accept
consulting gigs. Historically, I've been mainly doing this to compensate for a
certain lack of challenge and passion in my day job, and this is no longer an
issue. However, you may try. I've been known to take some consulting gigs of
varying lengths if the subject interested me enough. Folks have also paid me
just to have long and meaningful email conversations about subjects they
believed I'm knowledgeable in. So if you need help with a work project and are
willing to pay, you may approach me with a consulting proposal, but please state
it explicitly. The amount I've been charging recently is $150 per hour, but a
new quote may depend on the nature of the project.
</p>
<p>
To conclude, while I'm certainly happy to be receiving such emails and often can
provide the answers, this is not guaranteed. If you only get a polite "I can't
help" from me, don't take it personally. I'm just a regular person with limited
free time who has to carefully allocate what it's being used for.
