        <p>libjit is a very interesting project. It's a C library for generating executable machine code at runtime. As such, it can serve as a back-end of a JIT compiler. libjit was originally created as part of the larger DotGNU project (portable .NET runtime). Since DotGNU has been discontinued, libjit has fallen on and off into oblivion, but recently it's being maintained again.</p>
<p>libjit is not easy to get started with, and hence this series of articles. I spent a couple of days getting it to build and writing some simple programs using it, so I wanted to document this effort. libjit is one of those typical open-source projects in which the only real authority is the latest source code. Don't even look at the last &quot;released&quot; version - the code in Git is much more up-to-date. Similar for documentation: while the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libjit/doc/libjit.html">online docs</a> are a pretty good place to get started, they are direly out of date when compared to the source code. That said, the project's source code is clean and well-documented C, so it's pretty easy to grok. Also, the tutorial part of the documentation is useful - make sure you go over it before reading this post; otherwise, it may be difficult to understand what libjit is about.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-few-words-on-jits">
<h3>A few words on JITs</h3>
<p>JITs have become very popular in the past decade or so due to their use in popular mainstream languages like Java, JavaScript and C#. However, the idea of recompiling a program at runtime is almost as old as programming itself <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[1]</a>. Generating native machine code from higher-level bytecode at runtime is a concept many language designers have encountered in the past 50 years, and the problems/tradeoffs they ran into are comfortingly similar. In other words, it's an old and familiar problem.</p>
<p>While &quot;a JIT&quot; is usually thought about as part of some larger bytecode virtual machine (such as the JVM), it's a more general concept. I find the following way to think about this useful:</p>
<blockquote>
Whenever a program, while running, creates and runs some new executable code which was not part of the program when it was stored on disk, it's a JIT.</blockquote>
<p>libjit fits this description well, since it's more general than the traditional VM association of JITs is (even though libjit was also originally conceived for the purpose of implementing a VM). True, libjit can be used to speed-up a VM by compiling bytecode to machine code at runtime. But it can be used for other things as well:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Dynamic code generation from DSLs like regexes.</li>
<li>Dynamic code generation for specialized data structures and algorithms.</li>
<li>Implementing FFI (Foreign Function Interface) mechanisms for interfacing with native code.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we'll see, libjit is very general, so the possibilities are only limited by the imagination.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-libjit-api">
<h3>The libjit API</h3>
<p>[reminder: please go over <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libjit/doc/libjit_3.html">the tutorial in the official docs of libjit</a> before reading on]</p>
<p>I found the libjit API to be very well designed and intuitive. Once you spend some time with it, it becomes obvious how to do additional things without even looking them up. What follows is a short summary of how it works.</p>
<p>By means of its API calls, libjit builds an in-memory intermediate representation of a fairly low level bytecode. In formal terms, the IR  is based on a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-address_code">three-address code</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id2">[2]</a>. This is somewhat similar to LLVM IR, although there are also important differences. For example, unlike LLVM, libjit does not have a serialized textual or binary representation of its IR - it only exists in memory.</p>
<p>Some of the most important data structures / objects in libjit are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">jit_value_t</tt>: a generic <em>value</em> that serves as an argument to, and the potential return value from, libjit operations.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">jit_label_t</tt>: represents a jump target, just like in assembly languages.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">jit_function_t</tt>: represents a JIT-ed function that contains instructions and labels, can be compiled, run, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>JIT <em>instructions</em> are created by means of <tt class="docutils literal">jit_insn_*</tt> calls. These calls accept the function object to add the instruction to, as well as potentially some values and/or labels. If the instruction returns a value, the API call will return a <tt class="docutils literal">jit_value_t</tt> that represents it. Instructions are added to functions linearly - think of a function consisting of a sequence of instructions - each new <tt class="docutils literal">jit_insn_*</tt> call appends one instruction to the end of that sequence.</p>
<p>Let's now get to a complete example that shows how these interact in practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="building-libjit">
<h3>Building libjit</h3>
<p>First things first. I cloned the latest code from Git. libjit doesn't come with a <tt class="docutils literal">configure</tt> script; rather, it needs to be generated with autotools using the provided <tt class="docutils literal">auto_gen.sh</tt> script. I had to install <tt class="docutils literal">libtool</tt> first, and a couple of other build dependencies:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%">$ sudo apt-get install libtool flex bison texinfo
</pre></div>
<p>After this, I could run <tt class="docutils literal">./auto_gen.sh</tt> followed by the usual <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">configure-make</span></tt> sequence. <tt class="docutils literal">make check</tt> can also be used to run the tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linking-with-libjit">
<h3>Linking with libjit</h3>
<p>The libjit makefile creates both a static archive and a shared library, so you can choose whether you want to link libjit in statically or dynamically. Note that the library is quite large (a couple of MBs). Here's a portion of my makefile that compiles a program (<tt class="docutils literal">gcd_iter.c</tt>, which we'll see soon) and links it successfully with libjit:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%">LIBJIT_PATH = $$HOME/test/libjit

<h3>Creating a simple program</h3>
<p>The libjit tutorial has code for recursive GCD computation. Let's see how to write an iterative one, which contains a loop and somewhat more temporary value traffic. We'll build a JIT function that implements this algorithm:</p>

<p>The code should be quite readable now, but for extra points take a look at the reference documentation for the APIs used. Just a word of caution: the most up-to-date reference documentation for libjit is in code comments in the latests git snapshot.</p>
<p>Another note, on error reporting. libjit is, unfortunately, not very good at it. If you do something wrong, it will bite you. I've spent almost an hour chasing a bizarre stack-thrashing bug because <tt class="docutils literal">t</tt> was not initialized with <tt class="docutils literal">jit_value_create</tt>. I had initially written the code expecting <tt class="docutils literal">jit_insn_store(F, t, u)</tt> to just do the right thing. It doesn't. And it doesn't tell you about it either. Initialize your <tt class="docutils literal">jit_value_t</tt> variables!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interpreted-vs-compiled">
<h3>Interpreted vs. compiled</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the libjit API defines an IR for describing programs. libjit has a built-in interpreter that can execute programs directly from this IR, without lowering further to machine code. This is used on architectures for which libjit doesn't yet have a backend. On architectures that do have a backend (like the x86-64 machine I'm working on), the default build sequence will only link the machine-specific backend in.</p>
<p>This can be changed by passing the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--enable-interpreter</span></tt> flag to <tt class="docutils literal">./configure</tt>. The flag tells the configuration script to set up the interpreter as the backend, leaving the machine-specific code generators out. This can be useful for debugging libjit as well. We'll see some performance numbers for the interpreter later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-the-jit-ed-code-apply-vs-direct-invocation">
<h3>Running the JIT-ed code: apply vs. direct invocation</h3>
<p>How do we run the GCD function built by <tt class="docutils literal">build_gcd_func</tt>? The most straightforward way is using <tt class="docutils literal">jit_function_apply</tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%">jit_function_t gcd = build_gcd_func(context);

<span style="color: #007f00">// Compile (JIT) the function to machine code</span>
jit_context_build_start(context);
jit_function_compile(gcd);
jit_context_build_end(context);

<span style="color: #007f00">// Run the function on argv input</span>

jit_int result;
jit_function_apply(gcd, args, &amp;result);
</pre></div>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">jit_function_apply</tt> is a fully general method for invoking JIT-ed code from dynamic language runtimes. It makes no assumptions for the <em>caller</em> - the addresses of arguments are taken, and <tt class="docutils literal">jit_function_apply</tt> uses the signature of the called function object to figure out how to provide these arguments to the actual function (w.r.t. calling convention, etc) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id3">[3]</a>. It also provides the ability to compile the function on-demand, sets up libjit-specific exception handling, etc.</p>
<p>While great for dynamic language runtimes, when we just want to call JIT-ed code from a compiled C or C++ program, <tt class="docutils literal">jit_function_apply</tt> carries needless overhead. Since the caller in this case almost certainly has the same calling convention (or, in other words, shares the ABI) it's wasteful to go through this general process - why not just get the pointer of the entry point of the JIT-ed code and invoke it directly?</p>
<p>This is exactly what the libjit <em>closure</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id4">[4]</a> mechanism provides. Using a closure, the <tt class="docutils literal">jit_function_apply</tt> call is replaced with this:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">typedef</span> <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">int</span> (*FF)(<span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">int</span>, <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">int</span>);
FF gcd_f = jit_function_to_closure(gcd);
<span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">int</span> result = gcd_f(u, v);
</pre></div>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">jit_function_to_closure</tt> returns the address of the entry point (the first instruction) of the JIT-ed code. To call it directly, we must tell the compiler (of the calling code) how to interpret the address, by specifying a function pointer type.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="performance">
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>I ran the GCD computation on two large primes (which resulted in 17 iterations before returning 1), 5 million times in a loop, and compared the runtime of the various libjit run methods (interpreter, apply, closure) vs. the same function implemented in C and compiled natively with <tt class="docutils literal">gcc <span class="pre">-O0</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-O3</span></tt>:</p>
<img class="align-center" src="../../../images/2013/10/libjit_chart_1.png" />
<p>Some thoughts on these results:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The interpreter is indeed slow, but not as slow as I'd expect. I'm actually impressed that it provides reasonable performance, given how low-level the libjit IR is.</li>
<li>The large difference between apply and closure is due to the short function runtime. Only 17 iterations of the GCD loop fly by quickly, but for <tt class="docutils literal">jit_function_apply</tt> we pay the large overhead for switching from native to JIT-ed code on every call. If the function was longer-running, I'm sure that the difference between apply and closure would be smaller. Note also that the overhead is only paid when moving from native to JIT and back - calls bounded within the JIT-ed code are fast.</li>
<li>It does not surprise me that libjit (with the closure call approach) beats <tt class="docutils literal">gcc <span class="pre">-O0</span></tt>. Keep in mind that <tt class="docutils literal">gcc <span class="pre">-O0</span></tt> starts from C code, while for libjit we laid out a very low-level IR representation manually. So we've basically done all the compilation work and handed the results to execution. Still, some things (like register allocation and peephole optimizations) live below this level, which is why <tt class="docutils literal">gcc <span class="pre">-O3</span></tt> managed to produce code that's 25% faster than libjit.</li>

<h3>What's next</h3>
<p>In future parts of this article I intend to look at the machine code generated by libjit, as well as explore its other features such as calls from JITed to native code. All the code for the article is free (public domain) and available in my <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/libjit-samples">libjit-samples</a>  Github repository.</p>

It was just not called &quot;JIT&quot; those days - this term was coined for Java and taken from the world of manufacturing.</td></tr>

After discussing this with Aleksey Demakov, the current maintainer of libjit, I removed that part because libjit doesn't really use SSA. Store instructions may be used to assign different values to the same variable within a single basic block, and there are also no Phi nodes. In LLVM, on the other hand, all register values are kept in SSA form.</td></tr>
