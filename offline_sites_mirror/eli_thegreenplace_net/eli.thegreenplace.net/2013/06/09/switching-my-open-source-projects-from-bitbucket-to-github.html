<p>I'm switching my public open-source projects from Bitbucket to Github, and in the process also from Mercurial to git. But the switch has little to do with git vs. Mercurial; it's mostly about Github winning the platform war vs. Bitbucket. I like Mercurial, and it was a natural choice when switching from SVN a few years back. Back then I wasn't familiar with git, and I am quite a bit more familiar with it now, but still the actual SCM played little role in the decision.</p>
<p>Well, to be precise there's one thing I find slightly more convenient about git. I really like its throwaway-branch mode of development. I want to be able to create quick local branches for hacking, throw some away, merge others and keep my history clean. I want to commit every single comma if I feel like it, without worrying about polluting the &quot;official&quot; history. So <tt class="docutils literal">git merge <span class="pre">--squash</span></tt> or squashing with interactive rebasing are workflows I appreciate. It's not that these aren't possible with Mercurial, which recently gave up a bit on the pedanticism and allows similar workflows via extensions. But it's not the <em>natural</em> or the <em>familiar</em> way of working with Mercurial. As a proof of that, I kept receiving pull requests with dozens of useless small commits just to implement some feature, and kept asking the contributors to find a way to send me a single commit, or just leave the pull request machinery behind and send an old'n good patch file.</p>
<p>But I'm getting sidetracked. Github is just way, way more popular these days, especially for open source projects. I was very disappointed seeing many contributors say they're reluctant to contribute because that would require creating a Bitbucket account and fork my projects there. Would I please just switch to Github? sigh... I can understand that - Github managed to give coding a nice social aspect - your Github profile is part of your online &quot;rep&quot;. You want your contributions to other projects to be seen through it, so people were feeling that having a fork on Bitbucket is like this hidden place no one will ever see and attribute to them.</p>
<p>A curious anecdote of the relative popularity is something I noticed when I started doing the switch. I had more followers on Github than on Bitbucket! Oh my, even though I had a number of moderately popular open source projects I was furiously hacking on Bitbucket, vs. a bunch of half-neglected forks and hacks on Github.</p>
<p>So here it is; not an overly coherent set of thoughts, I'll admit, but I hope it makes sense. I don't have anything against Mercurial or Bitbucket - I'm still a user of both. But the higher-profile open-source projects are now on Github. Happy hacking.</p>
