        I want to archive for myself the following short essay by Ayn Rand, taken from <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_intro">here</a>. It is Ayn Rand's reply when asked to "present the essence of her philosophy while standing on one foot":

<blockquote>
<p>
1. Metaphysics: Objective Reality
</p><p>
2. Epistemology: Reason
</p><p>
3. Ethics: Self-interest
</p><p>
4. Politics: Capitalism
</p><p>

If you want this translated into simple language, it would read: 1. "Nature, to
be commanded, must be obeyed" or "Wishing won't make it so." 2. "You can't eat
your cake and have it, too." 3. "Man is an end in himself." 4. "Give me liberty
or give me death."
</p><p>

If you held these concepts with total consistency, as the base of your
convictions, you would have a full philosophical system to guide the course of
your life. But to hold them with total consistency—to understand, to define, to
prove and to apply them—requires volumes of thought. Which is why philosophy
cannot be discussed while standing on one foot—nor while standing on two feet on
both sides of every fence. This last is the predominant philosophical position
today, particularly in the field of politics.
</p><p>

My philosophy, Objectivism, holds that:
</p><p>

   1. Reality exists as an objective absolute—facts are facts, independent of
   man's feelings, wishes, hopes or fears.
</p><p>
   2. Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material provided
   by man's senses) is man's only means of perceiving reality, his only source
   of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic means of survival.
</p><p>
   3. Man—every man—is an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others.
   He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor
   sacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational self-interest
   and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life.
</p><p>
   4. The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is a
   system where men deal with one another, not as victims and executioners, nor
   as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free, voluntary exchange to mutual
   benefit. It is a system where no man may obtain any values from others by
   resorting to physical force, and no man may initiate the use of physical
   force against others. The government acts only as a policeman that protects
   man's rights; it uses physical force only in retaliation and only against
   those who initiate its use, such as criminals or foreign invaders. In a
   system of full capitalism, there should be (but, historically, has not yet
   been) a complete separation of state and economics, in the same way and for
   the same reasons as the separation of state and church.
