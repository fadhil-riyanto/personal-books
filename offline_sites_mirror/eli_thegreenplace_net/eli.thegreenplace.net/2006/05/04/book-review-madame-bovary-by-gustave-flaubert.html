      <p>
When this book was released in France in the middle of the 19th century, it
raised a public storm, as it deals directly with things that were still taboo at
that time - such as adultery, and hints of sexual behavior and fantasies. Had it
been released now, I doubt that "Madame Bovary" would get any recognition, as it
would be far from novel in today's society. But back then, it was indeed an
unusual book.
      </p><p>

I see something similar between this book and Don Quixote - Emma, having read a
lot of romantic books, dreamt of leading the life described in them rather than
her real life, and following this trail has eventually caused her to fall and
end her life in such a pitiful way. Don Quixote also found his doom by imagining
himself living in his books. While his books pictured brave knights fighting the
evil forces and saving damsels, Emmas dealt with the high society, its balls,
social meetings and many affairs.
      </p><p>

From my point of view, as a reader with some background in 19th century novels,
Emma's ways seem self defeating from the beginning. While the "shiny" high
society may seem to Emma tempting in books she reads, it is clear to me as a
reader who've read critical accounts of the society, that there's nothing good
there - just people desperatly trying not to die of boredom, doing everything to
avoid it, and ruin their lives on the way. Emma didn't eventually reach the high
society (though the ball the attended certainly played an important role in
setting her on the wrong path), but managed to ruin her life by acting as if she
did.
      </p><p>

The protagonists of this book are negative and impossible to connect to IMHO.
Emma is hardly a woman I'd like to do anything with - she deserves the treatment
of men like Rodolphe. Her husband Charles is a spine-less dope, who lets his
wife and his life to run away from his hands, hardly noticing. I'm sure that had
he been a normal man and a husband from the beginning of their marriage, he
could have placed his wife on a completely different path and actually live a
happy life.
