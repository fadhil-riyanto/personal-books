(read in Hebrew)
<p>
This is a story of Vladimir Girshkin, a young American (born in Russia) in his
quest to success in New York and in an illusionary Eastern-European city Prava
(most likely modeled after the Czech capital city Prague). Vladimir works as a
clerk in the immigration office, and is haunted by his parents to go study law.
After switching a couple of (overly) stereotypical girlfriends he gets involved
in a funny complication with the Catalan mafia and flees to Eastern Europe,
where he joins the local branch of the Russian mafia.
</p><p>

Written by a Russian-Jew immigrant in the United States, this book is reflective
on the author, in the sense that it tries to present the world-view of a
character that faces the same problems and doubts as the typical fresh U.S.
citizen of Russian origins.
</p><p>

The social issues addressed here are numerous: absorption of immigrants in
America, relations between parents and children (especially the success-crazed
quirks of Jewish families), the American youth living a "bohemian" life, and in
particular the feelings of a young immigrant feeling "neither here not there",
struggling to merge into society.
</p><p>

I must say I didn't like this book, mostly because I don't like books about
peple trying to "find themselves" and acting in peculiar, irrational ways on
their way. I just couldn't connect to any character in the story. Many reviews
note that there is a lot of enjoyable word-play in the book, but the Hebrew
translation (oh-so typically) managed to ruin that, though I could notice the
language is special and very funny at some places.
