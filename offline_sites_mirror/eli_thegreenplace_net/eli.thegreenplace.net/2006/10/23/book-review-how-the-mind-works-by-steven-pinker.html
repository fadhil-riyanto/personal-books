        Pinker is a psychology and linguistics professor who has lately come to
        fame as a prolific non-fiction writer, releasing a couple of
        best-selling books. "How the mind works" is a book he penned in 1997,
        and in which he tackles some of the most difficult introspective
        questions humanity faces - how do we actually "work" under the hood.
      </p><p>

This book can be divided into two major parts. The first part tackles the
question stated in the title more directly. Pinker explains the prevailing
belief that the human brains are just powerful multi-parallel computers,
providing recent research highlights that try to deal with this difficult
subject. He devotes quite a few pages to the interesting topic of visual
perception - how the brain forms the three dimensional images from two
dimensional light projections on the retina, and how we actually come to
recognize the objects we see. He also tries to explain the simplest words
possible how neural networks work, conjecturing how human thoughts and
computations in the brain may be a result of massive networks of highly
interconnected neurons. 
      </p><p>

This topic is certainly very complex, and if anything, this book shows just how
much we don't know yet. One interesting thing to note is the ingenious
experiments people concoct in an attempt to decipher small bits of the great
riddle. I always enjoy reading about such experiments, and Pinker presents an
especially interesting one, in which very young babies are shown objects and
their reaction to them is recorded. Since the babies hasn't gotten a chance to
be influenced by the environment yet, their reactions display pretty well the
hard-coded circuits in our brain, the connections shaped by evolution.
      </p><p>

The second part is evolutionary psychology. There was not much new here for me
since I've already read a couple of books on the subject, but it's always
refreshing to take another look at such a complex subject, from the angle of
another author. Pinker presents the basic notions of evolutionary psychology
very well, and I enjoyed reading this part as I find the topic absolutely
fascinating. Getting to understand human actions based on evolutionary premises
is very satisfying for my ever-rationalist mind.
      </p><p>

I was a little dissapointed by the last chapter in the book. It didn't deliver
the promise of its glaring title ("The meaning of life"), and instead discussed
why we find music and arts pleasing. I didn't, of course, expect the chapter to
actually tell me what the meaning of life is, but I did hope for something at
least close to the question. Another issue that left me with mixed feeling was
Pinker conjecturing on the un-graspability of human cognition. He raises the
question of whether we can, in theory, understand our awareness and
consciousness, or is it a lost cause, in the same league with trying to imagine
objects in the 4th dimension. I surely hope this isn't true, and that with
further research we will be able to understand consciousness.
