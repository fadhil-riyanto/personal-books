        When someone says that "people like flocking, like sheep" it's usually
        meant in a derogatory way. However, when it comes to programming,
        flocking may be very useful. If you're a dedicated hacker, you can
        surely have a lot of fun implementing a language of your own, adding to
        it tools of your own, and using it to develop software, but when it
        comes to solving real problems rather than reinventing the wheel all the
        time, when it comes to creating interesting and useful programs quickly
        and effectively, a strong community support is essential. A strong, wide
        community means better modules that solve a wide range of already solved
        problems, in a more efficient way and with less bugs. It also means a
        strong support base which you can use when you're stuck solving your
        challenges.
    </p><p>

This is what makes Perl such a wonderful language for writing programs quickly.
Although the Perl 5 language itself is far from perfect, and many valid claims
can be said about its deficiencies, its powerful user community still makes it
the best language out there to just <em>get things done</em>. CPAN - the Perl
archive of modules and Perlmonks - the community forum, are the two best things
about Perl, things other languages lack. For there is no other language I know
of that has a module archive as comprehensive and useful as CPAN, and as great a
user community support as the one at Perlmonks.
    </p><p>

On the other hand, there is Lisp. I don't want to start a discussion here, but
in my humble opinion on a <em>pure language-wise</em> basis Lisp is superior to
Perl (and probably to any other language out there). This is all good and well
while hacking at toy projects for fun. When it comes to creating real, useful
applications quickly, Lisp falls far behind Perl. The reason for this is, I
believe, is fragmented, small and belligerent community.
    </p><p>

First of all, the name Lisp stands for a family of programming languages. The
family consists of two major dialects - Common Lisp and Scheme and several
smaller ones (Newlisp, Arc, EuLisp and others). Of the two major dialects,
Common Lisp seems to be more practical and uniformly supported, as the Scheme
community is smaller and is further sub-divided into different implementation
specific dialects.
    </p><p>

The Common Lisp community consists of a few loosely coupled module archives
(nothing even resembling CPAN in breadth and quality) and a discussion group -
comp.lang.lisp (formerly a Usenet newsgroup, now part of Google Groups).
comp.lang.lisp has an interesting history, but to tell it I want to first define
what a flame war is. 
    </p><p>

The term "flame war" was coined on Usenet to describe a discussion that has
slided from professional rails and moved to personal insults - a heated exchange
between two or more posters - a "noisy" brawl. Such "wars" often result from
people called "flamers" or "trolls" who act in a deliberately hostile and
insulting way, such as posting "C sucks, long live Fortran" in comp.lang.c, or
claiming for years that they've found a simple proof of Fermat's Last Theorem on
sci.math, objecting any attempt to criticize the obviously incorrect proof steps
they present (look up "James Harris" on sci.math).
    </p><p>

Well, comp.lang.lisp is a champion of flame wars. In fact, it is my firm belief
that during the past few years extensive flame wars made the group barely useful
for sane discussion of Common Lisp. The biggest problem here is a complete
resistance to any form of introspection. I will clarify this point: by
introspection I mean the act of people discussing the relative merits of the
language their group is devoted to, and acknowledging its shortcomings. There is
something in the comp.lang.lisp atmosphere that's wholesomely opposed to such
study. It probably didn't start with him, but one man's acts have played a major
role in this - the Norwegian Common Lisp programmer Erik Naggum.
    </p><p>

Now would be a good time to search for "Erik Naggum" in the Common Lisp archive
- 10 minutes spent reading the search results should leave a good understanding
of what he was. "Was", because Naggum bade farewell from comp.lang.lisp a couple
of years ago after another noisy flame war (of which there were many). And yet,
as much as the CL community will hate to admit it, and as much as its leading
members have fought against Naggum for years, in some metaphorical way Erik
Naggum is what Common Lisp and its community are. He is an experienced
programmer of the highest level - his wizardry is apparent from the serious
discussions he took place in. This is probably what leads to his inflated sense
of total and utter perfection. Any objection, any misunderstanding leads
immediately to an articulate rebuttal which very quickly descends to personal
tones.
    </p><p>

And yes, I think it still represents the comp.lang.lisp group, even in the
post-Naggum area. Just look up the latest debate of the shortcomings of Common
Lisp that was incited by Steve Yegge. Lisp is as close to a perfect programming
language as any, and its zealots guard it rabidly. Criticism isn't tolerated.
Ignorance isn't tolerated - which drives many newbies away quite quickly. Lisp
has been attacked so much before, that any post by a newbie meekly seeking an
advice on some arcane feature gets immediately interpreted as criticism and
turns into a flame war. True, Erik Naggum was the main cause of such flame wars
in the past, but he wasn't the only one. Wake up, Common Lisp gurus - your
language is so unpopular because of <em>you</em> - there is no one else to
blame. If you ever asked yourself why is CL much less popular than the obviously
"brain dead" Perl (paraphrasing Naggum's favorite Perl quote), the answer is the
community, that is <em>you</em>. Try logging into Perlmonks, and ask a simple
newbie question, wondering why something works like <em>this </em> and not
<em>that</em>. Note the answers you will get. Unless your post is obvious flame
bait, you will be answered in a helpful way, often by some of the most
high-standing Perl luminaries. Now, compare this to comp.lang.lisp !
    </p><p>

So, true, Lisp is a great language. Many seasoned programmers come to
acknowledge it after a few years of looking for the best language to program in.
However, after 40 years, it's still not ready for the "big world", and that's
because of the user community. Once comp.lang.lisp learns to accept that (1)
their language is not perfect, but there's nothing fundamentally bad about it,
and (2) not all programmers are wizards, especially in their first couple of
years on the craft, Common Lisp might just experience a renaissance. I sure hope
to see that happen.
