<p>
So, I've had the EEE for about a few days now, and have formed some initial
impressions of it. Overall, it's very cool - an amazing toy. Small, light,
completely silent - and a full-blown computer inside.
</p><p>

The screen is very good - excellent visibility and viewing angle. It's a shame
it is so small (7"). The LCD itself doesn't take up all the space of the inside
of the top-lid, probably because of price considerations. Asus could've easily
placed a 9" screen in its place (which I hope they do in future editions).
</p><p>

The built-in speakers are less bad than could be expected from such miniature
size. It has a built-in microphone too, and allows to connect external
headphones and microphone.
</p><p>

The keyboard and touchpad are of good quality. Their small size takes some
getting used to - especially the keyboard, which for now hinders  my typing
speed as I keep hitting the wrong keys (I'm writing this post from the EEE by
the way). The right shift key is very small which is annoying.
</p><p>

Connecting the EEE to my home wireless network and sharing folders from and to
it was very easy, which is great. 
</p><p>

The OS is Xandros Linux (a fork off Debian) - intalling apps from repositories
is a piece of cake. I've already installed the Scite editor (and configured it
with all my settings as on the Windows computers I use it on), and
build-essential (the package with gcc and make in it). Linux also means you have
a console (I've changed the default Xterm to Konsole, which I like much more) -
I love the console !!! I'm not too familiar with 'bash' (yet) since I'm more
used to C-shell, so I'm not as efficient as I could be - but this will improve.
</p><p>

I've also installed Stardict - an excellent free dictionary program that sits in
the background and translates selected text in pop-up windows. With this, I'll
be able to comfortably read Spanish books.
</p><p>

There are some problems as well, though. First, the EEE is not very stable.
Sometimes it hangs during shutdown, for example. Word on the street is that Asus
hurried to put the software together and it's not 100% polished. Fortunately,
most of the problems can be overcome easily.
</p><p>

Second, the small amount of space. Due to the way Linux application installation
works, apps should be installed to the same partition as the OS - and I have
only 2 gigs of internal SSD here. Unfortunately, if you uninstall pre-installed
apps (like the huge Open Office, which I don't need anyway) - it doesn't free
space because it's in the OS partition. This, of course, can be tweaked. Another
way to go is to install an OS on an external SD card and just boot from it. The
amount of possible tweakings is endless, and the EEE Wiki has tons of
information on the subject.  Since I'll need a workable EEE in Munich next week,
I'll play it safe for the time being and won't get into adventures that can ruin
the OS. After I come back, however, I'll make sure to tweak it to suit my every
whim. After all, it's a toy, isn't it :-)
