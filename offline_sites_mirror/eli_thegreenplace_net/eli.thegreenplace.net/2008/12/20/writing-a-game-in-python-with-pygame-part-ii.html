        <p>This is part II of the <a class="reference external" href="../../../tag/pygame-tutorial.html">&quot;Writing a game in Python with Pygame&quot; tutorial</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="welcome-back">
<h3>Welcome back</h3>
<p>In the first part of this tutorial we've created a simple simulation of &quot;Creeps&quot; - round creatures moving around the screen and bouncing off walls. Not much of a game there, but a good start nonetheless.</p>
<p>In this part, we are going to extend this simulation, making it much more game-like. It is not the final step, of course. The final product of this part is still going to be far from a real, interesting game, but many useful game programming concepts will be introduced, and the simulation will definitely have much more feeling of a game in it.</p>
<p>Here's a teaser screenshot of the final product of this part:</p>
<img src="../../../images/2008/12/creeps_screenshot_2.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-code">
<h3>The code</h3>
<p>The full code for this part can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/main/2009/pygame_creeps_game">from here</a>. As before, it is highly recommended to download it, run it and have it open in the editor while reading this tutorial.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="goals-for-this-part">
<h3>Goals for this part</h3>
<p>In this part I'm going to cover:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A prettier background for the game</li>
<li>Responding to user events</li>
<li>A more complex internal state for the creeps</li>
<li>Simple animation</li>
<li>Rendering text</li>
</ul>
<p>So let's get started.</p>
</div>
<!--more-->
<div class="section" id="background">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In the first part we've just splashed a bucket of greenish swamp-like color onto the screen and called that a background. Since we want the game to be a bit more appealing, this won't do any longer.</p>
<p>We'll now <em>tile</em> a pretty background image onto the screen, and create a bounded &quot;game field&quot; for the creeps to roam in.</p>
<p>What is tiling, you ask? Tiling, in simple terms, is taking a small surface and repeating it in a pattern until a larger surface is covered. In our case, we'll take this image:</p>
<img src="../../../images/2008/12/brick_tile.png" />
<p>And tile it in a simple repeating-row pattern. The code doing it is in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">draw_background</span></tt> function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #00007f">draw_background</span>(screen, tile_img, field_rect):
    img_rect = tile_img.get_rect()

    nrows = <span style="color: #00007f">int</span>(screen.get_height() / img_rect.height) + <span style="color: #007f7f">1</span>
    ncols = <span style="color: #00007f">int</span>(screen.get_width() / img_rect.width) + <span style="color: #007f7f">1</span>

    <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">for</span> y <span style="color: #0000aa">in</span> <span style="color: #00007f">range</span>(nrows):
        <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">for</span> x <span style="color: #0000aa">in</span> <span style="color: #00007f">range</span>(ncols):
            img_rect.topleft = (x * img_rect.width,
                                y * img_rect.height)
            screen.blit(tile_img, img_rect)

    field_color = (<span style="color: #007f7f">109</span>, <span style="color: #007f7f">41</span>, <span style="color: #007f7f">1</span>)
    draw_rimmed_box(screen, field_rect, field_color, <span style="color: #007f7f">4</span>, Color(<span style="color: #7f007f">&#39;black&#39;</span>))
</pre></div>
<p>The loop does the tiling. The last line of the function creates the <em>playing field</em> - a dark-brown filled rectangle to which the creeps will be restricted. The field is drawn using the utility function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">draw_rimmed_box</span></tt> - it's very simple, and you can study it on your own <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>In the game screenshot above you can also see another box with some text on the right. This is drawn separately, and we'll get to it soon enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hey-you-ve-clicked-me">
<h3>Hey, you've clicked me!</h3>
<p>So far the only user event our game has responded to was closing closing the game window. Not much interaction there, so we'll pump it up. Here's the new event handler in our main loop:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">for</span> event <span style="color: #0000aa">in</span> pygame.event.get():
    <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">if</span> event.type == pygame.QUIT:
        exit_game()
    <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">elif</span> event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
        <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">if</span> event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
            paused = <span style="color: #0000aa">not</span> paused
    <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">elif</span> (  event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN <span style="color: #0000aa">and</span>
            pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[<span style="color: #007f7f">0</span>]):
        <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">for</span> creep <span style="color: #0000aa">in</span> creeps:
            creep.mouse_click_event(pygame.mouse.get_pos())
</pre></div>
<p>A couple of things were added. First, there's a handler for the user's pressing the space key on the keyboard. This flips the &quot;paused&quot; state of the game - try it now.</p>
<p>The second handler is only slightly more complex. When a left mouse button is clicked inside the application, each creep gets its <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mouse_click_event</span></tt> method called with the mouse click coordinates.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: creeps have <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">health</span></tt>, and we can decrease their health by successfully clicking on them. A health bar is drawn above each creep showing its health as a proportion of red to green (click on some creeps to see their health decrease).</p>
<p>The implementation is also quite simple. Here's the mouse click handler of a creep:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #00007f">mouse_click_event</span>(<span style="color: #00007f">self</span>, pos):
    <span style="color: #7f007f">&quot;&quot;&quot; The mouse was clicked in pos.</span>
<span style="color: #7f007f">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">if</span> <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>._point_is_inside(vec2d(pos)):
        <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>._decrease_health(<span style="color: #007f7f">3</span>)
</pre></div>
<p>You see that when the click was found to be inside the creep, its health is decreased. Let's see how the click inside the creep is detected:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #00007f">_point_is_inside</span>(<span style="color: #00007f">self</span>, point):
    <span style="color: #7f007f">&quot;&quot;&quot; Is the point (given as a vec2d) inside our creep&#39;s</span>
<span style="color: #7f007f">        body?</span>
<span style="color: #7f007f">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    img_point = point - vec2d(
        <span style="color: #00007f">int</span>(<span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.pos.x - <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.image_w / <span style="color: #007f7f">2</span>),
        <span style="color: #00007f">int</span>(<span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.pos.y - <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.image_h / <span style="color: #007f7f">2</span>))

    <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">try</span>:
        pix = <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.image.get_at(img_point)
        <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">return</span> pix[<span style="color: #007f7f">3</span>] &gt; <span style="color: #007f7f">0</span>
    <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">except</span> IndexError:
        <span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">return</span> <span style="color: #00007f">False</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This method detects if the click is inside the creep. More specifically, inside the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">solid</span> <span class="pre">area</span></tt> of the creep's image. Clicking inside the creep's bounding box but outside its body won't result in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">True</span></tt>. Here's how it's done:</p>
<p>First, the click point is recomputed to be relatively to the creep's image. If the point isn't inside its image on the screen, there's nothing to talk about. If it is inside, we still don't know if it's in the solid region. For this purpose, the pixel at the point of the click is examined. If the alpha constituent of the point is positive, this is part of the creep's body. Otherwise, it's just part of its bounding box but outside the body (see <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id2">[2]</a>).</p>
<p>Drawing the health bars is very simple, and you should be able to understand the code of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">draw</span></tt> method (which replaces <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blitme</span></tt> from the code of part I) that implements this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="simple-animation">
<h3>Simple animation</h3>
<p>What happens when the creep's health goes down to 0? I hope you've already experimented with the game and saw it, but if you didn't, here's a screenshot:</p>
<img src="../../../images/2008/12/explode1.png" />
<p>If you've played with the game, however, you've surely noticed that the explosion the creep undergoes is animated - it's changing with time.</p>
<p>What is an animation? In its simplest form, it is a sequence of images that are drawn one after another in the same location, creating the appearance of movement. It's not unlike our creeps moving on the screen (you can see the whole game as an animation, really), but for the sake of this part I'm specifically referring to a <em>static</em> animation that stays in the same place.</p>
<p>The animation is implemented in the module <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">simpleanimation.py</span></tt> which you can find in the downloaded code package. You can experiment with it by running it standalone (the module uses Python's <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span> <span class="pre">__name__</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">&quot;__main__&quot;</span></tt> feature to allow stand-alone running).</p>
<p>The code should be very simple to understand, because there's nothing much to it. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SimpleAnimation</span></tt> class receives a list of image objects and draws them to the screen with the given period and duration. Note how the explosion is simulated by taking the same image, rotating it by 90 degrees and using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SimpleAnimation</span></tt> to change the two in rapid succession.</p>
<p>Back in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">creeps.py</span></tt>, our creep uses <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SimpleAnimation</span></tt> to show its own explosion after its health has reached 0:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #00007f">_explode</span>(<span style="color: #00007f">self</span>):
    <span style="color: #7f007f">&quot;&quot;&quot; Starts the explosion animation that ends the Creep&#39;s</span>
<span style="color: #7f007f">        life.</span>
<span style="color: #7f007f">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.state = Creep.EXPLODING
    pos = ( <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.pos.x - <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.explosion_images[<span style="color: #007f7f">0</span>].get_width() / <span style="color: #007f7f">2</span>,
            <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.pos.y - <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.explosion_images[<span style="color: #007f7f">0</span>].get_height() / <span style="color: #007f7f">2</span>)
    <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.explode_animation = SimpleAnimation(
        <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.screen, pos, <span style="color: #00007f">self</span>.explosion_images,
        <span style="color: #007f7f">100</span>, <span style="color: #007f7f">300</span>)
</pre></div>
<p>It's very straightforward, really.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creep-state">
<h3>Creep state</h3>
<p>The creeps of this part are much more complex than of part I. They have health which can decrease, and they can explode and disappear. To manage this complexity, we're going to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">state</span> <span class="pre">machine</span></tt> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>What states can the creep be in? A normal state, when the creep is roaming around, an exploding state in which the creep is replaced by the explosion animation, and an inactive state, in which the creep no longer functions. These are coded as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>(ALIVE, EXPLODING, DEAD) = <span style="color: #00007f">range</span>(<span style="color: #007f7f">3</span>)
</pre></div>
<p>See the code of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">update</span></tt> for state management - the creep is updated differently, depending on which state it's in. The same is true for the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">draw</span></tt> method. It's a good idea now to search for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">self.state</span></tt> throughout the code, taking note of where the state is modified, and where it is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="displaying-textual-information">
<h3>Displaying textual information</h3>
<p>When you run the game (or in the large screenshot at the top of this part), you'll see a simple scoreboard in the top right corner of the screen. It counts the amount of active creeps on the screen, and will also display an exciting message when you've killed all the creeps.</p>
<p>This display is implemented in the function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">draw_messageboard</span></tt> - study its code now, it should be quite simple to understand in conjunction with <a class="reference external" href="http://pygame.org/docs/ref/font.html">the docs</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sprites-and-sprite-groups">
<h3>Sprites and sprite Groups</h3>
<p>I hope you've noticed that in both parts of the tutorial, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Creep</span></tt> class derives from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pygame.sprite.Sprite</span></tt>. <a class="reference external" href="http://pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html">Sprite</a> is a utility class of Pygame that implements some useful common methods for managing the animated images that represent the actors of the game (known in game programming jargon as <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)">sprites</a>).</p>
<p>In the first part I didn't use any of its capabilities at all. Here, I'm using its capability of being collected into <a class="reference external" href="http://pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.Group">sprite Groups</a>.</p>
<p>The list of creeps in the main function has now turned into a sprite group. The cool thing is that whenever a sprite is added to a group, it keeps track of which groups it's in, so calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">self.kill()</span></tt> in a sprite causes it to be removed from all the groups and thus from the game. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">update</span></tt> method of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Creep</span></tt> calls <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kill()</span></tt> when the explosion has ended. This way, the main loop doesn't have to explicitly keep track of which sprites are active in the group - they do it themselves.</p>
<p>That said, I'm still not sure I'm going to use the full capabilities of Sprites. For me, they're just a guideline, not a must. Perhaps I'll find out later that my code can be structured better with them. Or perhaps I'll see I don't need them at all. We'll see <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id4">[4]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wrapping-up">
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
<p>All the goals stated in the beginning of this part were achieved, so that's it, for now. We've turned the simplistic creeps simulation into something resembling a rudimentary game. True, it's more likely to pave your way to severe <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">RSI</a> than cause you any serious fun, but it's a simple game nonetheless. Not bad for just 450 lines of Python code!</p>
<p>In future parts of this tutorial, we'll continue developing the code on our way to a real game, so stay tuned. Oh, and give the exercises a go, I guarantee you they will make your understanding of the material much deeper.</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img class="align-center" src="../../../images/hline.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 5px;" /></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exercises">
<h3>Exercises</h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Try to pause the game (press SPACE), click a couple of times on a creep, and resume the game. Notice that the creep's health decreased? Try to fix this, i.e. block mouse events during the pause.</li>
<li>Can you see that when a creep is facing diagonally, his health bar is a bit farther from his body than when he's facing up or to the side? Can you figure out why? (Hint: re-read the section of part I dealing with the size of the rotated image). Propose ways to fix this.</li>
<li>Review the code of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_explode</span></tt> method. Note the complex computation of the explosion's position. Why is it needed? Try to modify it (for example, removing the consideration of the explosion image's size) and observe the difference.</li>
<li>Add a running clock to the scoreboard. It should begin at 00:00 and advance by 1 each second. When the game ends, the clock should stop.</li>

If you examine the image with an image editor that supports transparency (Paint.NET or GIMP, for example), you'll see that the area outside the creep's round body is transparent. This is used to blend the creep in a pleasing way into its background, and can also be employed to detect what's inside and what's outside of the creeps's body.</td></tr>
