<p>
The main topic tackled in this book is the level at which natural selection
acts. Ask a random person (who groks natural selection and Darwinism) and you
will most probably get an answer that natural selection acts at the level of the
organism. Some will even go farther to say that sometimes natural selection acts
at the level of groups of organisms, even species.
</p><p>

Dawkins, however, thinks differently. Though I'm pretty sure that he claimed it
in <em>The Selfish Gene</em> as well, this book is entirly dedicated to
demonstrate that natural selection acts at the level of the gene.
</p><p>

In his own words (p. 4):
</p><p>

<blockquote>The thesis that I shall support is this. It is legitimate to speak
  of adaptations as being 'for the benefit of' something, but that something is
  best not seen as the individual organism. It is a smaller unit which I call
  the active, germ-line replicator. The most important kind of replicator is the
  'gene' or small genetic fragment. </blockquote>
</p><p>

Seeing how organisms compete is easy and intuitive, but what does it mean for
genes to compete ? Dawkins makes a crisp definition (p. 154):
</p><p>

<blockquote>Natural selection at the gene level is concerned with competition
  among alleles for a particular chromosomal slot in a shared
  gene-pool.</blockquote>
</p><p>

Moreover, since the basic unit of natural selection is the gene, its effects are
not even confined to individual organisms. The organisms are a convenient but
arbitrary frontiers for the phenotypic effects (external expressions) of genes,
hence the 'extended phenotype' (p. 248-249):
</p><p>

<blockquote>[...] I have amended this to a new central theorem of the extended
  phenotype: An animal's behaviour tends to maximize the survival of genes 'for'
  that behaviour, whether or not those genese happen to be in the body of the
  particular animal performing the behaviour. [...] I am suggesting that the
  individual performing the behaviour is not the entity for whose benefit the
  behaviour is an adaptation. Adaptations benefit the genetic replicators
  responsible for them, and only incidentally the individual organisms
  involved.</blockquote>
</p><p>

While this book expounds important points, I have a word of warning. It is not
intended for the lay reader, but rather for a professional student or
practitioner of genetics and biology. As Daniel Dennett says in the afterword
(p. 266):
</p><p>

<blockquote><em>The Selfish Gene</em> was written for educated lay readers, and
  glided over many of the intricacies and technicalities that a proper
  scientific assessment needs to consider at length. <em>The Extended
    Phenotype</em> was written for the professional biologist, but so graceful
  and lucid is Dawkins's writing that even outsiders who are prepared to
  exercise their brains vigorously can follow the arguments, and appreciate the
  subtlety of the issues.</blockquote>
</p><p>

Now, if Dennett, one of the most brilliant philosophers of the 20th century,
notes that one has to exercise his brain vigorously to really understand the
book, take it as a dire warning. This book is no pop-science. I, for once,
having read a few of Dawkins' books and many others on evolution and Darwinism,
found it very hard to follow, and almost impossible to read more than a few
pages in a single sitting.
</p><p>

In some places Dawkins writes as if the book is just another scientific article
(which, in a sense, it is). Pages upon pages of references to other books and
papers, arguments from one author to another, and so on. Not very easy to
follow, indeed.
</p><p>

So would I recommend this book ? I'm not sure. If you haven't read at least 5
other books on natural selection, Darwinism and genetics, definitely stay away.
If you're more knowledgeable in these topics, you might find this book an
interesting, though very challenging read. For people with professional interest
in genetics, the book is probably a must, because it sets this exciting field in
the (almost certainly) correct philosophic framework.
