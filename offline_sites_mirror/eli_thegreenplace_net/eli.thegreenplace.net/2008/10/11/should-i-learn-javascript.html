      <p>
It's some time now that I'm wondering whether I should spend the time required
to get acquainted with Javascript. So, this post is a pseudo-random dump of
arguments <strong>for</strong> and <strong>against</strong> this idea.
      </p><p>

<strong>For:</strong> I'll be able to tweak my blog's various plugins that use
Javascript. Most of them do, and when I want to customize them to my needs, I
often find myself stumped because of my almost complete lack of understanding of
what's going on. It's not the language itself (which is simple), but rather the
whole DOM / AJAX / events idea that I simply have to learn about.
      </p><p>

<strong>Against:</strong> As the argument above hints, to learn JS is not just
to learn the language. The language is C-like and relatively simple, it seems.
The problem is with all the mountain of frameworks, concepts and libraries that
must be learned. To be really good in JS, one has to understand DOM, events,
AJAX, connection with server-side code (PHP), common libraries (JQuery,
Prototype), CSS and much, much more. Oh, and don't get me started on learning
all the quircks of the various browsers, all of which seem to understand JS a
bit differently.
      </p><p>

Stevey says <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/language-grubbing">here</a> that
application programming is often harder than systems programming. <a href="http://www.yosefk.com/blog/low-level-is-easy.html">Here's</a> a more
detailed discussion of the topic. I agree. The problem is - you have to learn so
much frameworks and libraries to be proficient in something, that the
application level starts looking hard.
      </p><p>

<strong>For:</strong> But JS is really cool! It is, really. Recently I realized
that some of the applications I'm writing at home would be most usable as web
applications. But for that, one has to construct a usable front-end in the
browser, and for this knowledge of JS is required. JS these days is the
canonical way to build in-browser "GUIs" to web applications, and knowing it is
essential for constructing usable tools.
      </p><p>

<strong>Against:</strong> I'm usually trying to direct my learning efforts to
directions that would benefit my work. But JS has absolutely nothing to do with
what I do at work (the technical aspects of which are either FPGA coding in
VHDL, low-level C for micro-controllers or Python scripts for everything
PC-based).
      </p><p>

<strong>Against:</strong> I know myself. I can't learn something <em>just a
  little</em>. If I start, I'll invest a lot of time into this. I'll learn the
language itself, the browser DOM model, AJAX, connection to server side
scripting, debugging, compression, some of the popular libraries like JQuery. It
will take a long time, and I have to think what other spare-time hacking
activities will get less attention.
