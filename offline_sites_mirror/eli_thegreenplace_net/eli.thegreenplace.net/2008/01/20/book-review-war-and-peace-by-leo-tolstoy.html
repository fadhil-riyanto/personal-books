<p>
This is the second time I've read this book. The first was a copy I borrowed a
few years ago, and now I've purchased one for my own library. I try to collect
good books I really loved reading, and "War an peace" easily falls into this
category.
</p>
<p>
It is an epic novel in the truest sense of "epic". Stretching over a period of
several decades, it masterfully describes the history of Russia from the end of
the 18th century and into the first third of the 1800s. At more than 1600 pages,
it is definitely one of the longest novels out there, but unlike many much
shorter books, its length is well justified. I can barely count on the fingers
of one hand the amount of times I felt some section is too long. Although
Tolstoy is very thorough, his writing is easily readable and the pages just fly.
</p>
<p>
The books focuses on two main topics. One is the Russian-French wars of 1805 and
1812. Tolstoy describes the wars, and in particular the battles of Austerlitz
(1805) and Borodino (1812) in vivid detail and apparently very accurately from a
historic point of view. The characters of Napoleon and Kutuzov (the Russian army
leader) take active part in the narration, with the lesser leaders (Bagration,
de Tolli, Davoux) also getting enough attention to build a complete and
interesting story. Specific events of the war are highlighted with the
participation of the book's main characters, like Andrey Bolkonsky, Nikolay
Rostov and Pierre Bezoukhov.
</p>
<p>
The other is the high Russian society of that time. The book provides a very
interesting and in-depth glimpse into this unusual society by today's standards,
somewhat modeled after, and thus similar to, other European societies (French,
British, etc.). Tolstoy also presents the life in rural Russia a little, and the
interrelations between the rich and the serfs, although he doesn't spend on this
topic nearly as much as in Anna Karenina.
</p>
<p>
The characters in the book are various and present the different ideas Tolstoy
tries to infuse into his narration. They are all, without exception, extremely
believable and well developed. I can't think of many authors who know how to
present and develop their characters as well as Tolstoy.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the book presents plenty of interesting philosophical and
scientific ("science of history") ideas. The chief one is undoubtedly the
question "What causes and shapes historical events?". Contrary to the popular
dogma that historical events are the result of actions of single notable persons
(such as Napoleon or king Alexander), Tolstoy believes that such persons don't
really cause events, but rather can only affect them in some ways once they are
already in existence. He claims that what really changes history is the amalgam
of human actions, built from thousands, nay, millions of small decisions,
desires and ambitions of the people. A historical version of chaos theory.
</p>
<p>
Well, this review can be arbitrarily long, and I have to wrap up at some point.
I just want to address one important issue - the book's name. In Russian, the
book's name is "Voina i mir", which may mean "War and peace" but may also mean
"War and society", since "peace" and "society" are homonyms in Russian. There
are differences of opinion as to which Tolstoy actually meant when he authored
the book, as you can read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace">here</a> or more at length <a href="http://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/4332/">here</a> (Russian). Personally,
I firmly believe that the "War and society" translation is more correct. It is
very obvious that Tolstoy places a lot of emphasis on society in the book.
Pierre compares his experiences in the society with his war adventures to form
philosophical opinions. The same for Andrey. I can barely see any mention of
peace in its "non-war" sense in the book.
