      <p>
This blog runs on Wordpress, and I'm quite happy with it. It's simple to
configure and use, is very well supported and the huge amount of plugins and
extensions make every wish come true almost automatically. When we had to open a
<a href="#">trave log</a>, I didn't think twice before using Wordpress for that
too. Regardless of the general theme of this post, I'm thankful for Wordpress,
and do think that its developers and maintainers deserve kudos on creating such
a great piece of software, for free.
      </p><p>

Wordpress is implemented in PHP, like most popular web applications. In the
world of (open-source) web applications, PHP is a 500-ton train sweeping
everything else aside. Do you need a CMS ? No problem, have Drupal or Joomla. A
photo-album ? There's Coppermine (which I'm also using for <a href="#">our online
photo album</a>). Need a forum ? Everyone knows that phpBB rulez. And some of
the big competitors, like punBB and Invision are also written in PHP.
      </p><p>

There are literally truckloads of articles online explaining the popularity of
PHP, so I won't just drop another leaf into it. Rather, I just want to express
an opinion that it's <em>a damn shame</em> that this is the situation, because
PHP is a bad language that encourages bad programming practice, which makes
tinkering with large PHP painful.
      </p><p>

I'm a natural tinkerer, and my Wordpress blog is self-customized in several
minor ways. I've also customized some of the plugins I use for my special needs.
I can't describe the disgust and horror I sometimes experience when fixing or
changing something in Wordpress's PHP code. So much things are global - the
variables, the hooks, the functions. Even after PHP added OOP, most code doesn't
use it, or only uses it in a very rudimentary way as module-like wrappers. PHP
is probably an ideal language for applications to which many sub-competent
hackers add code. It has almost no "accepted style" and people place no limits
on what they do. This is a real shame.
      </p><p>

I firmly believe that Python is a superior language to PHP. In all domains
except web programming it's also much more popular, so I'm really saddened by
the lack of competition to PHP web apps from Python's side. There's absolutely
nothing in Python that makes it less suitable for web applications than PHP -
it's simply a matter of custom.
      </p><p>

Therefore, I think it would be really great if at least one of the big-gun web
apps was written in Python. Maybe a competitor to Wordpress, or a forum
software. I, for once, would be delighted to use it once it's stable enough. And
it shouldn't be too hard, either. All it would take is a single dedicated and
talented Python hacker, perhaps in a setting like the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Google Summer of Code</a>. Take
Wordpress for instance. It weighs less than 30 KLOC of PHP code. Even assuming
that PHP-Python translation is 1-to-1, brushing some of the more advanced
features aside the Python replacement could easily be written in a summer. At
first, it can mimic the Wordpress architecture to make the transition easier.
Then, once the project gains users and momentum, the code can be slowly and
surely refactored to bring more good Python practices in.
      </p><p>

I hope someone will start such an endeavor. Perhaps the Django team could offer
it as a GSoC project for a Wordpress replacement using Django (which would
surely shave lots of code, as WP itself is written in pure PHP w/o any framework
beneath).
