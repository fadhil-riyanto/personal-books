        I've had enough of the <a href="../../15/cpr-to-my-computer-again/index.html">heat problems</a> with my computer, so this week I bought a new one. 

The full spec is:

<ul>
	<li>Intel Core 2 Duo E4600 2.4 Ghz (back to Intel after 8 years with AMD!)</li>
	<li>Asus P5KPL-CM motherboard</li>
	<li>Kingston 2GB of DDR II 800 MHz memory</li>
	<li>Seagate 320GB SATA II Hard disk</li>
	<li>Sapphire ATI Radeon HD 3450 Graphics Card</li>
	<li>Thermaltake Swing mid-tower case</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this purchase, I tried to optimize on best heat-resilience, so the CPU is
relatively cool[1], there are no fans on either the motherboard or the graphics
card, and the case has a single large (12 cm) fan in the back, and a washabale
filter in the front.
</p>

<p>
When I tried to install Windows XP Pro from my installation CD on it, I ran into
a problem. Shortly after loading modules to memory (and before asking on which
partition to install), a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bsod">BSOD
</a>appeared with the error:
</p>

<pre>
***stop 0x0000007E ( oxc 0000005, oxf9a380bf, oxf9e84208, oxf9e834208, 0xe9e83f08

*** PCI.SYS address f9a380bf base at f9a31000, date stamp 3b7d8ssc
</pre>

<p>
My first thought was "crap, a hardware problem", which was quite depressing, for
a shiny new computer a few hours old. So, I booted from a <a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/">UBCD </a>and ran some hardware test, which
went OK. I then tried installing Ubuntu Linux 8 on it, and it also went OK. The
OS installed and booted successfully - the computer seemed to be working.
</p><p>

So what's wrong with the Windows installation ? At this point I was quite
stumped and began Googling. It quickly turned up some interesting results. It
appears that the plain old Windows install CD (w/o SP2) doesn't handle PCI
Express graphics cards. Advice ranged from trying to disable PCI Express in the
BIOS before installing, or removing the graphics card, but people reported mixed
success. What was successful for everyone was, however, installing from a CD
that contains Windows XP SP2. There's even an <a href="http://www.theeldergeek.com/slipstreamed_xpsp2_cd.htm">interesting
article</a> that explains how to create such a CD from an old Windows XP (no
SPs) installation CD and the download of SP2 form Microsoft.
</p><p>

Luckily, I found a CD with the installation of Windows XP Home SP2 at home,
which came with Anna's laptop. I installed the computer from it - it all went
smoothly and I had Windows XP running and activated in half an hour. Another
couple of hours and I had all my drivers and most important installs in place,
as well as my backed up data back from the backup external HD.
</p><p>

There is one concern left, and that is the difference between XP's Home and Pro
editions. I've always used Pro before, and have concerns of what I might be
losing with Home. An article (link long dead...) lists some differences, but not
all are accurate. For instance, it says that XP Home doesn't support multiple
processors, but it appears to have no problems supporting and using my dual-core
CPU. It also says that XP Home doesn't support multiple-languages installs,
which is also false - I've easily configured it to support a Hebrew keyboard
layout.
</p><p>

XP Home seems to have many limitations in networking, but for my home network
with 2-3 computers, it seems to be doing what I need, which is sharing files and
a printer. The only real difference I'm feeling is that it doesn't have Remote
Desktop capabilities, but this is not too bad. So I'll be running XP Home now,
it seems.
</p><p>


[1] I ran two instances of the CPU Burn-in stress test. After about 2 minutes
the CPU temperature (measured with <a href="http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php">SpeedFan</a>) stabilized at ~58C,
which doesn't look like too much. When idle, the temperature is around 40C.
