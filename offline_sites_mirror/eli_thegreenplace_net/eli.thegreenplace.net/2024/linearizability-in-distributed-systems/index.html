                <p>Linearizability is a strong <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model">consistency model</a>
in concurrent and distributed systems. From the paper introducing it <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Linearizability provides the illusion that each operation applied by
concurrent processes takes effect instantaneously at some point between
its invocation and its response.</blockquote>
<p>On first reading (and probably on the second and third...) this sounds a bit
abstract, but it really is all there is to it. A slightly different way to
think about it is - a linearizable system appears as if there's only one copy
of data in existence, and all client operations apply to this data atomically.
This post dives deeper into what this means in practice.</p>
<div class="section" id="registers">
<h2>Registers</h2>
<p>Linearizability is a <em>single-object</em> consistency model (see the &quot;Linearizability
vs. Serializability&quot; section below for more on this).
It's common in distributed systems literature to talk
about a <em>register</em> - a single key-value pair, for example, stored in some
distributed database. When clients write and read this register concurrently,
we can analyze the history of operations and their results and determine if
the system maintains linearizability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basic-example">
<h2>Basic example</h2>
<p>The following diagram describes a sequence of register reads and writes by
three different clients; some of these operations are done concurrently. Time
flows from left to right, and a colored rectangle denotes an operation; its
left edge is the operation's start, and its right edge the operation's
completion <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>.</p>
<img alt="Linearizable history scenario 1" class="align-center" src="../../images/2024/linearizable-sc1.png" />
<p>Here are the events, each with its own number in the yellow bubble:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Client A reads the register and gets the value of 0. The read itself
happened at some point in time in the database, denoted on the timeline
in the very bottom of the diagram.</li>
<li>Client B reads the value 0. Note that this read operation is partially
concurrent with the write operation (3); concurrent operations can execute
in any order, but here (2) happened to be executed before (3) (we know
this because the value 0 was read, not 1).</li>
<li>Client C writes 1 into the register.</li>
<li>Client A reads 1 from the register. This read is also concurrent with the
write, and thus could end up with any result, but since the result in this
timeline is 1, we know it happened after (3).</li>
<li>Client B reads 1 from the register.</li>
</ol>
<p>This sequence of events is valid in a linearizable system, because we can
construct a serial history of events (the bottom timeline) that's consistent
with our results. Each event occurs instantaneously at some point between the
start and finish of the client request.</p>
<p>Compare this to the following sequence, which is not valid:</p>
<img alt="Linearizable history scenario 2" class="align-center" src="../../images/2024/linearizable-sc2.png" />
<p>This sequence is similar to the first one, with one difference: B's read in
(5) results in 0. Since (5) is concurrent with (3), when seen in isolation
this isn't unreasonable. However, since in (4), client A already observed
the value 1 in the register and (4) happens before (5), this sequence is
invalid in a linearizable system. We can imagine systems with weaker
consistency guarantees producing this history, but such systems are not
linearizable.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is examine the timeline in the bottom of the diagram.
Notice that (5) reads 0, after (3) happened. We just can't find a way to
arrange this history so it looks sequential - therefore, it's inconsistent
with linearizability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-more-subtle-example">
<h2>A more subtle example</h2>
<p>Here's a more subtle example, taken from the linearizability paper:</p>
<img alt="Linearizable history scenario 3" class="align-center" src="../../images/2024/linearizable-sc3.png" />
<p>This sequence of events is invalid for a linearizable system! To
understand why, let's follow the timeline at the bottom of the diagram.</p>
<p>(3) Client B's write of 1 executes before (2) client A's read, because A
reads 1 from the register. If the read at (2) happened before the write
at (3), it (the read) would result in 0, not 1.</p>
<p>Event (4) has to happen after event (2), since it starts after (2) ends.
But we've just reasoned that (2) happens after (3); therefore, (4) happens
after (3) - even though these two writes are concurrent, their order is
imposed by observing other events.</p>
<p>Finally, since we've just proven that (4) happens after (3), the value in the
register at the conclusion of (3) is 0, not 1; therefore, the read of 1 in (5)
is invalid. This system cannot be linearizable. As before, you can try
to arrange the events in the bottom of the diagram into some sequential order -
this attempt will fail, because no consistent sequential order can account
for the observed events.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-formal-definition">
<h2>A formal definition</h2>
<p>I personally found the formal definition of linearizability in the Herlihy &amp;
Wang paper somewhat obscured by attention given to potentially unfinished
operations. If we assume that every operation has a start and an end, it's
easier to restate the formal definition as follows.</p>
<p>An operation <em>e</em> has the timestamps <em>start(e)</em> and <em>end(e)</em>; these are the
left and right boundaries of the rectangles in the diagrams shown above.</p>
<p>A history <em>H</em> exists with a strong partial order <object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/756c241ac5f91f469be969adf19eba8be013f3d6.svg" style="height: 13px;" type="image/svg+xml">&lt;_H</object> on operations <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3">[3]</a>:
<object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/da680da9f55778b0b7ae1936f4f9d9e83f7686cb.svg" style="height: 13px;" type="image/svg+xml">e_0 &lt;_H e_1</object> if <object class="valign-m5" data="../../images/math/98d60fef24c45831a1c414f7c97ef09d586c7a02.svg" style="height: 19px;" type="image/svg+xml">end(e_0)</object> precedes <object class="valign-m5" data="../../images/math/c4a35986d620d327ab562a7d0a5a603e11425181.svg" style="height: 19px;" type="image/svg+xml">start(e_1)</object> in <em>H</em>.
Operations unrelated by <object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/756c241ac5f91f469be969adf19eba8be013f3d6.svg" style="height: 13px;" type="image/svg+xml">&lt;_H</object> are said to be <em>concurrent</em> in H.
In our diagrams, <em>H</em> represents the observed history (the part of the diagram
with the overlapping rectangles). The formal definition captures what it
means for us to know that some operations precede others, while other operations
are concurrent.</p>
<p>For example, in our last diagram above if <em>H</em> is the history shown, then
<object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/ee5009cacbd76077cf901db78a83bf5014f6c7c0.svg" style="height: 13px;" type="image/svg+xml">e_3 &lt;_H e_5</object>, but the pair <object class="valign-m4" data="../../images/math/bc1f891fff9987dabf9906aa81786141b784d60a.svg" style="height: 12px;" type="image/svg+xml">e_3,e_4</object> is not in the relation
<object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/756c241ac5f91f469be969adf19eba8be013f3d6.svg" style="height: 13px;" type="image/svg+xml">&lt;_H</object>, since these operations are concurrent.</p>
<p>If <em>H</em> is a sequential history, then <object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/756c241ac5f91f469be969adf19eba8be013f3d6.svg" style="height: 13px;" type="image/svg+xml">&lt;_H</object> is a <em>total order</em>. It means
there are no concurrent operations.</p>
<p>Now it's time for the definition of linearizability. <em>H</em> is linearizable if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>H</em> is equivalent to some sequential history <em>S</em></li>
<li><object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/21bc4a1cae8b4f606a98282c4c93be246a3673fb.svg" style="height: 14px;" type="image/svg+xml">&lt;_H \subseteq &lt;_S</object></li>
</ul>
<p>The second item requires a bit of elaboration: recall that <object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/756c241ac5f91f469be969adf19eba8be013f3d6.svg" style="height: 13px;" type="image/svg+xml">&lt;_H</object> and
<object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/cdd6694fe341fc295fff7257a7031c88365c1bf8.svg" style="height: 13px;" type="image/svg+xml">&lt;_S</object> are <em>relations</em>. <object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/756c241ac5f91f469be969adf19eba8be013f3d6.svg" style="height: 13px;" type="image/svg+xml">&lt;_H</object> being a subset of <object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/cdd6694fe341fc295fff7257a7031c88365c1bf8.svg" style="height: 13px;" type="image/svg+xml">&lt;_S</object> means
that the partial order of operations in the real-time history <em>H</em> is preserved
in the linearization.</p>
<p>We then call <em>S</em> the <em>linearization of H</em>. In our diagrams, <em>S</em> is the bottom
line where operations are shown on the server happening immediately; they are
still represented by <em>start(e)</em> and <em>end(e)</em> in the history (we can just assume
<em>start(e)</em> and <em>end(e)</em> are infinitesimally close in time, since the DB applies
operations atomically).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linearizability-vs-serializability">
<h2>Linearizability vs. Serializability</h2>
<p>Linearizability is often confused with <em>serializability</em> - another consistency
model. The two are fundamentally different, though:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Serializability is a multi-object property useful to describe transactions
that consist of multiple operations that may potentially touch multiple
objects; informally, it means that transactions happen atomically, and their
sub-operations cannot be observed in isolation or intermix.</li>
<li>Linearizability is a single-object property, talking about the observed
effects on a single register, as this post demonstrates.</li>
</ul>
