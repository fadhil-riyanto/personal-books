                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;A City on Mars&quot; By Kelly and Zach Weinersmith - actual discussion of building
settlements on Mars occupies maybe 1% of this book. The authors have an
uncanny talent of focusing on all the least interesting aspects of space
exploration; whatever little is dedicated to science and engineering is
fairly shallow and reeks of techno-pessimism. That said, if the aspects of
space exploration that interest you most are politics, social structures,
legal frameworks, labor relations and mental health - go ahead and read this
book. Overall, I found it infuriatingly bad.</li>
<li>&quot;What You Are Looking For Is in the Library&quot; Michiko Aoyama - a sweet little
collection of loosely-related short stories. Just regular people living their
lives in Japan; the common theme is changing circumstances and how to deal
with them. I really enjoy books of this kind, and this one is very well done.</li>
<li>&quot;Is this Wi-Fi Organic?: A guide to spotting misleading science online&quot; by
Dave Farina - a valiant attempt to build up a solid scientific foundation
for debunking myths (focusing mostly on alternative medicine). Unfortunately,
the execution falls short. The tactic employed by the author is: explain
a bunch of science at a pretty shallow level, then present some claim to
debunk and then immediately jump to &quot;this is clearly false, becasue science&quot;.
Rinse; repeat. While entertaining, this isn't very convincing. From a book,
I'd expect much more. For example, Simon Singh's &quot;Trick or Treatment&quot; is much
better in this respect, because the debunking done with a lot of supporting
evidence, citing relevant research and studies. The good thing I can say
about this book is that I appreciate the techno-optimism and the science-first
approach.</li>
<li>&quot;An imaginary tale&quot; by Paul J. Nahin - tells the history of the discovery
and initial applications of the imaginary unit - <em>i</em>. Very interesting book
that fills an under-served niche between popular science and textbooks. The
book isn't easy to go through - it requires sophisticated math, at least at
the engineering undergrad level. Except the last chapter - which goes a
bit off the rails with complex analysis - this background should be sufficient
for the vast majority of the book, but some work will still be required.
While I didn't follow through every single calculation, I really enjoyed the
book overall and should try to read additional stuff by this author.</li>
<li>&quot;The Code Breaker&quot; by Walter Isaacson - a biography of Jennifer Doudna,
focusing on the discovery of CRISPR, the competition around it, the ethical
implications of gene editing and COVID vaccine research. An OK book overall,
with some really tedious parts; not the best Isaacson, in my experience.</li>
<li>&quot;An Immense World&quot; by Ed Yong - secondary title &quot;How Animal Senses Reveal
the Hidden Realms Around Us&quot;; an information-packed book with a huge scope,
describing the sensing capabilities animals possess beyond the human range.
Very interesting.</li>
<li>&quot;Mansfield Park&quot; by Jane Austen - familiar style and topic - the lives of
the bored 19th century English gentry. I liked this book less than others
by Austen I read; the characters aren't as well developed (I feel like there
are too many? Austen seems to have neglected to provide distinct roles for
several), and the first half of the book is fairly dull.</li>
<li>&quot;How to Avoid a Climate Disaster&quot; by Bill Gates - a decent overview of the
current state of global warming, and what it would take to avoid the
worst-case scenario. This book could be much better, IMHO, if it had more
depth and a coherent summary/plan. I'm also surprised by the relatively
shallow coverage of nuclear (fission) power, given the importance attributed
to it by Gates. Also, the coverage of carbon capture is surprisingly minimal.
On the good side, I really liked the concept of &quot;green premium&quot; and how to
factor that into economically realistic solutions. This is one of those
subjects that's moving so fast, however, that it needs a fresh treatment
every few years. This book is from 2020 and already some information feels
stale due to the huge progress in solar deployments that's been made in the
past few years.</li>
<li>&quot;On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft&quot; by Stephen King - a mix of autobiography
with some advice on writing creative fiction. Very good overall. King's
relationship with his family is inspiring and endearing - not the usual
celebrity fare. One small gripe is that the book is artificially inflated with
some tangential interviews at the end, so it's actually shorter than
advertised.</li>
<li>&quot;Engineering in Plain Sight&quot; by Grady Hillhouse - the author is well-known
from his YouTube channel &quot;Practical Engineering&quot;, and this book is a text
presentation of many of the topics he discusses in his videos. The writing
is unmistakable in Hillhouse's enthusiastic style and the illustrations are
beautiful. In all, a very nice book.</li>
<li>&quot;Children of Time&quot; by Adrian Tchaikovsky - first part of a sci-fi trilogy
about space-faring humans and... spiders. Highly imaginative and fun to read.</li>
<li>&quot;Journeys North: The Pacific Crest Trail&quot; by Barney Scout Mann - a memoir
of a person thru-hiking the full PCT in 2007, and some stories about his
fellow hikers. Great book.</li>
<li>&quot;The Final Frontiersman&quot; by James Campbell - subtitle is &quot;Heimo Korth and
His Family, Alone in Alaska's Arctic Wilderness&quot;. Very nice biography about
a fur trapper family living in a remote self-built cabin in north-east Alaska.
Covers a period roughly from the 1980s to the early 2000s.</li>
