                <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;Dr. Euler's Fabulous Formula&quot; by Paul J. Nahin - a kind of sequel to the
previous book I read by this author (&quot;An imaginary tale&quot;). Here he collected
all the interesting mathematical explorations that didn't make the cut for
that book. I found this one to be much closer to a textbook on the math
spectrum - most pages are crammed to the brim with integrals. Not easy
bedside reading, for sure, though it's still a good book and I appreciate
the author's enthusiasm about these topics.</li>
<li>&quot;Sid Meier's Memoir!: A Life in Computer Games&quot; by Sid Meier - an
autobiography by the famous computer game designer, best known for his
Civilization series. I think I was confused by what &quot;designer&quot; means in
Meier's case, because it turns out he's a coder extraordinaire who was
churning multiple solo-written games every year in the 1980s and into the
1990s. This book is very interesting and insightful; the author exudes
charming good nature, optimisim and some real hard-won design wisdom. A
delightful read for fans of the genre.</li>
<li>&quot;Pnin&quot; by Vladimir Nabokov - some notes on the life of a professor of Russian
who emigrated to the US around WWII and teaches at a fictional New England
college. The writing is masterful, but overall I felt like this novel's main
point eluded me - there's probably certain groups it was very relevant to, but
not me.</li>
<li>&quot;Churchill - walking with destiny&quot; by Andrew Roberts - a modern biography of
Winston Churchill, augmented with documents that only became available in the
last couple of decades. Even though this book is a behemoth (over 1000 pages
in the printed edition, 50 hours on audio), it's surprisingly readable
and engaging. The author does his best at being objective, providing detailed
accounts of criticism against Churchill and his failures. Nevertheless, the
character of the man emerging from this book is extremely impressive and
inspiring. I should probably try reading one of Churchill's own books - I
had no idea he was such a prolific and highly regarder author (with a Nobel
prize in literature).</li>
<li>&quot;The Chip&quot; by T.R. Reid - secondary title is &quot;How two Americans invented
the microchip and launched a revolution&quot;. Tells the story of the
simultaneous discovery of integrated circuits by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce.
The first half of the book is fascinating; the second half is not as good and
mostly seems to be a filler.</li>
<li>&quot;How to rule the Universe, without alerting the orderlies&quot; by Gregory
Khait - (read in Russian) yet another collection of short stories, with
some new stories on the interim period of immigration when people were
stuck in Europe while waiting for US visas. At least 1/3 of the stories
are repeats from previous books.</li>
<li>&quot;I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life&quot; by
Ed Yong - talks about the symbiosis of bacteria with multi-cellular
organisms, providing many examples of research findings from the animal and
kingdoms, including humans. The book is interesting, but this is a topic that
moves quickly, so the material gets outdated fast. Mostly, my impression was
surprise at how little we know about these things. The science here is
definitely in its infancy.</li>
<li>&quot;The computational beauty of nature&quot; by Gary William Flake - &quot;computer
explorations of fractals, chaos, complex systems and adaptation&quot;. A nice
book with some interesting code samples, but most of it feels awfully
outdated a quarter century after publishing. It's quite impressive that the
C code it bundles is still easy to compile and run, though.</li>
<li>&quot;Math for English majors&quot; by Ben Orlin - alas, by far Orlin's weakest work
IMHO. It's not clear what this book is even trying to do - a list of
humorous definitions for various mathematical terms? Drawing parallels
between elementary math and English grammar? I'll update this review if this
book becomes popular with my kids, but so far it seems unlikely.</li>
<li>&quot;The Guns of August: The Outbreak of World War I&quot; by Barbara W. Tuchman - a
detailed history of the events leading to the outbreak of WWI and its first
month or so, in which Germany's attack into France was eventually blocked
and the Western front settled into the years-long trench warfare deadlock.
I found the first half of the book - dealing with the politics leading to
the war - the most insightful. It pairs wonderfully with one of my favorite
books - &quot;All quiet on the Western front&quot;, because it's a perfect contrast of
the decisions made in the upper eschelons vs. the reality on the ground for
millions of soldiers. The second half is more of a classical military history
of events, and I wasn't particularly impressed by it.</li>
<li>&quot;Tom Swan and the Head of St George&quot; by Christian Cameron - a wild adventure
story set in the late crusades era. A young English knight's escapades in
Italy, Greece and Turkey, full of unrealistic fighting, womanizing and
drinking. Occasionally fun, but mostly pretty silly. I don't think I'll be
reading the rest of the books in this series.</li>
<li>&quot;Poverty Safari: Understanding the Anger of Britain's Underclass&quot; by Darren
McGarvey - a memoir of a Scottish rapper about growing up in a poor,
dysfunctional family in Glasgow in the 1990s, sharing his views of the
class-based social divides of society. The author's own struggles with
alcoholism and mental health issues play a major role in the book. Some parts
of this book are insightful, especially on the topic of class divides within
the liberal left.</li>
