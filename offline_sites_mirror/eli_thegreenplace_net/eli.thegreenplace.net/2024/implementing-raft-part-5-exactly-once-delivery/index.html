                <p>This is Part 5 in a series of posts describing the Raft distributed consensus
algorithm and its complete implementation in Go. Here is a list of posts in the

<li>Part 5: Exactly-once delivery (this post)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this part, we're completing the implementation of a replicated key / value
database based on Raft consensus. At the end of Part 4 we discussed a
consistency issue that may arise due to client retry logic; now is the time
to address it.</p>
<p>All the code for this part is located
in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/raft/tree/main/part5kv">this directory</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="adding-an-append-operation-to-our-database">
<h2>Adding an <tt class="docutils literal">APPEND</tt> operation to our database</h2>
<p>As a quick reminder, these are the basic operations our KV DB from part 4
supports:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">PUT(k,v)</tt>: assign value <tt class="docutils literal">v</tt> to key <tt class="docutils literal">k</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">GET(k)</tt>: retrieve the value associated with key <tt class="docutils literal">k</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">CAS(k, cmp, v)</tt>: atomic compare-and-swap. First, it reads <tt class="docutils literal">curV</tt> - the
current value associated with key <tt class="docutils literal">k</tt>. If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">curV==cmp</span></tt>, assigns value
<tt class="docutils literal">v</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">k</tt> instead; otherwise, it's a no-op. In any case, <tt class="docutils literal">curV</tt> is
returned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's add another operation to this set; this is <tt class="docutils literal">APPEND(k,v)</tt>, which appends
<tt class="docutils literal">v</tt> to the value of key <tt class="docutils literal">k</tt> (in our implementation, keys and values are
both arbitrary Go strings); if there was no <tt class="docutils literal">k</tt> in the DB before this
operation, it behaves like <tt class="docutils literal">PUT(k,v)</tt>.</p>
<p>For example, consider this sequence of commands (in order from left to right):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>PUT(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;)  APPEND(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)  APPEND(&quot;y&quot;,&quot;hello&quot;)
</pre></div>
<p>Applied to an empty DB, these commands will result in these keys / values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>x=foobar
y=hello
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-problem-with-client-retries-demonstrated-with-append">
<h2>The problem with client retries - demonstrated with <tt class="docutils literal">APPEND</tt></h2>
<p>The way our KV client works is described in detail in
<a class="reference external" href="../implementing-raft-part-4-keyvalue-database/index.html">Part 4</a>. As a reminder,
the client tries the KV services one by one, submitting a command to them until
it gets a success response from a leader. The client also remembers which
service was the leader the last time it tried, to avoid wasting time on the
search next time.</p>
<p>Suppose we've already submitted <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PUT(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;)</span></tt> successfully to the database,
and now we want to send the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">APPEND(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;)</span></tt> command. Suppose also that
our client remembers that service B was the leader (in a cluster of three
services: A, B and C). It sends the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">APPEND(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;)</span></tt> request to service
B. What happens if the client doesn't get a response from B? It assumes
something happened to B (maybe it has crashed or was partitioned from the
network), and retries the same request - sending it to C.</p>
<p>But now suppose that B actually received the APPEND command and committed it
to the Raft cluster, but crashed before sending the HTTP response back to the
client (or maybe the HTTP response got delayed beyond the client's timeout,
due to a network glitch). Due to the same error, B then loses cluster leadership.
The client will keep retrying this request, until
it finds a leader that answers with success; therefore, the APPEND may
be applied twice (or even more times, if the failure mode recurs) and the value
of <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> in the DB will end up being <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;foobarbar&quot;</tt>. This is bad!</p>
<p>You may be tempted to blame the client's retry behavior here; but let's think
this through. Suppose we didn't have the client layer doing retries; we send
an APPEND command to a service, and don't hear anything back. What do we do
next? Is there any way to know that the request was actually committed? Well,
we can send a GET request to check, but this quickly gets complicated in a real
distributed system, because our operation is no longer atomic (some other client
may have changed the key's value since then, so what is our GET supposed to
check?).</p>
<p>The problem isn't the retry itself; it's retrying with insufficient safety
guarantees in the core algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solving-the-retry-problem-with-command-de-duplication">
<h2>Solving the retry problem with command de-duplication</h2>
<p>The problem described above isn't just an issue in our implementation. It's
explicitly called out in the original Raft paper, in section 8:</p>
<blockquote>
However, as described so far Raft can execute a command multiple times: for
example, if the leader crashes after committing the log entry but before
responding to the client, the client will retry the command with a new
leader, causing it to be executed a second time. The solution is for clients
to assign unique serial numbers to every command. Then, the state machine
tracks the latest serial number processed for each client, along with the
associated response. If it receives a command whose serial number has already
been executed, it responds immediately without re-executing the request.</blockquote>
<p>The paper also suggests a solution to the problem, and this is what we're
going to implement. If we can uniquely identify commands committed to the
Raft log, the KV service can avoid applying the same commands twice.</p>
<p>The idea is to identify commands uniquely as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each client has a globally unique ID</li>
<li>Each command sent by a client has a unique ID, distinct from all other IDs
sent by the client. Moreover, to make our algorithm efficient this ID is
monotonically increasing; assuming each client has its own monotonic clock,
a command sent at time <object class="valign-m4" data="../../images/math/2885fa41d340ab94bb0451308cf01996f1916011.svg" style="height: 16px;" type="image/svg+xml">T_1</object> will have an ID larger than a command
sent at <object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/9aa7b71de925cf0af7c914ee94140a522d6b84ac.svg" style="height: 15px;" type="image/svg+xml">T_0</object> iff <object class="valign-m3" data="../../images/math/8967f572b209645f22cd7dbd1eef806527ee6c90.svg" style="height: 15px;" type="image/svg+xml">T_1&gt;T_0</object>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our APPEND example, let's say the client's ID is 42, and let's say the ID
of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">APPEND(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;)</span></tt> command it sends is 1. The command is sent to B,
which commits it successfully - with the ID tuple <tt class="docutils literal">(42,1)</tt> - to the Raft log;
B crashes before responding to the client, so the client retries the command
with C. Since it's the same command, it has the same ID tuple <tt class="docutils literal">(42,1)</tt>. The KV
service in C will notice that such an ID was already applied, and will not apply
it again <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementing-de-duplication">
<h2>Implementing de-duplication</h2>
<p>We'll start with the client. Two fields are added to the <tt class="docutils literal">KVClient</tt> struct:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// clientID is a unique identifier for a client; it&#39;s managed internally</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// in this file by incrementing the clientCount global.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nx">clientID</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">int64</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="c1">// requestID is a unique identifier for a request a specific client makes;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// each client manages its own requestID, and increments it monotonically and</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// atomically each time the user asks to send a new request.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nx">requestID</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">atomic</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Int64</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">clientID</tt> field is assigned when a client is created, using a global
atomic that auto-increments:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">func</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">New</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">serviceAddrs</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[]</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">KVClient</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">KVClient</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="c1">// ... other fields</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nx">clientID</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w">      </span><span class="nx">clientCount</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="c1">// clientCount is used to assign unique identifiers to distinct clients.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kd">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">clientCount</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">atomic</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Int64</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>This provides uniqueness for our tests, but in realistic applications you'll
probably want something stronger. A simple and pragmatic
approach could be using an <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID</a> here - I'll
leave this as an exercise for motivated readers.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">requestID</tt> field tracks the ID of the last request this client has
sent. Each time the client sends a new request, this is incremented <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>.
For example, here's the new <tt class="docutils literal">Append</tt> method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// Append the value to the key in the store. Returns an error, or</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// (prevValue, keyFound, false), where keyFound specifies whether the key was</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// found in the store prior to this command, and prevValue is its previous</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// value if it was found.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kd">func</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">c</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">KVClient</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ctx</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">context</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Context</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">key</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">value</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">bool</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">error</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Both IDs are part of the HTTP request sent to service. Here's the request
struct for appends:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">AppendRequest</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">Key</span><span class="w">   </span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">Value</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">ClientID</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="kt">int64</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">RequestID</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">int64</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>The other commands are modified similarly; all the retry logic (in the <tt class="docutils literal">send</tt>
method) remains the same - it just keeps retrying with the same client+request
IDs.</p>
<p>The changes in the service are slightly deeper, but not too difficult overall.
First, we add a field to the <tt class="docutils literal">KVService</tt> struct:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// lastRequestIDPerClient helps de-duplicate client requests. It stores the</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// last request ID that was applied by the updater per client; the assumption</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// is that client IDs are unique (keys in this map), and for each client the</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// requests IDs (values in this map) are unique and monotonically increasing.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nx">lastRequestIDPerClient</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">map</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">int64</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="kt">int64</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>We also add some fields to the <tt class="docutils literal">Command</tt> struct:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// ClientID and RequestID uniquely identify the request+client.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nx">ClientID</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">RequestID</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">int64</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="c1">// IsDuplicate is used to mark the command as a duplicate by the updater. When</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// the updater notices a command that has a client+request ID that has already</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// been executed, the command is not applied to the datastore; instead,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// IsDuplicate is set to true.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nx">IsDuplicate</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">bool</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>

<p>For duplicates the service returns a special API status:
<tt class="docutils literal">api.StatusDuplicateRequest</tt>. Our client treats this as an error and surfaces
it to the user. As an exercise, try changing it so the return value from
duplicates is normal (success). The challenge here is to record - for each
request - what the result is for returning to the client (e.g. the previous
value of a key in case of PUT or APPEND).</p>

<div class="section" id="revisiting-our-consistency-guarantees">
<h2>Revisiting our consistency guarantees</h2>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="../implementing-raft-part-4-keyvalue-database/index.html">Part 4</a>,
we've discussed the consistency guarantees of our KV service in detail, and
concluded that it's strict serializable, which is the strongest consistency
guarantee for distributed systems.</p>
<p>However, when adding the client module we've also noted that - due to the client
retry problem - the whole system is no longer <a class="reference external" href="../linearizability-in-distributed-systems/index.html">linearizable</a>
(and hence no longer strict serializable). Linearizability extended to the
client is known to be tricky; this isn't surprising - after all, the client
is yet another network-connected component in the system, with inherently
unreliable communication to the service.</p>
<p>With de-duplication, our entire system is strict-serializable again. Even if
a client re-sends a command that was already committed to the Raft log, this
retried command won't be committed a second time due to the de-duplication
logic. Users will not observe non-linearizable behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exactly-once-delivery">
<h2>Exactly-once delivery</h2>
<p>The discussion around delivery semantics can get quite heated - people have
strong feelings about a topic in which academic rigor is often insufficiently
applied. Still, I'll take the chance of discussing these semantics in the
context of the Raft-based KV DB we've built through this series of posts.</p>
<p>Consider a case in which we have no client retries. A client submits a user's
request just once to the underlying Raft service. Raft guarantees that if the
system is sufficiently connected (e.g. there are enough live and connected
peer to achieve consensus), the command will be applied to the Raft log once.
The Raft protocol is both theoretically and practically proven at this point,
so let's take this as an axiom. So we can say that without client retries,
a command is delivered <em>at most once</em>. It can fail to be delivered (if there's
a persistent network partition preventing the Raft cluster from having enough
live peers for consensus), but it will not be delivered more than once.</p>
<p>For some applications, at most once delivery is a sufficient guarantee. Think
about some sort of distributed logging or telemetry, for example. This isn't
the case for the kind of KV DB we're trying to build, though, because it's
intended to serve as a rock-solid basis for other distributed applications.</p>
<p>Next we've added client retries; this is essential in light of the imperfect
physical world in which our code operates. With client retries, assuming the
HW and network is working &quot;in the long term&quot; (e.g. network partitions get
fixed within some reasonable time, and crashing servers get restarted or
replaced), we get <em>at least once</em> semantics. The client will just keep retrying
until it gets notified that the command was applied. However, as we've seen at
the beginning of this post, this also means duplicate delivery when some failure
scenarios occur.</p>
<p>The goal of adding de-duplication is to move our system to <em>exactly-once</em>
delivery. Exactly-once delivery is a highly debated topic, but with some
reasonable real-world assumptions, it can be achieved. Consider our implementation,
for example (with de-duplication of retries). As long as the network and HW are
not permanently broken, a command will either be applied <em>exactly once</em> to the
DB, or the client will be notified of an error.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://blog.rongarret.info/2024/09/yes-you-can-have-exactly-once-delivery.html">Here's a post by Ron Garret</a> where
he provides a useful framework to think about this. The post is long but worth
reading; here's a quote I liked:</p>
<blockquote>
If you can get at-least-once delivery, you can build exactly-once on top of that</blockquote>
<p>I believe this Raft series has demonstrated how this is done.
Another interesting read is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/exactly-once-semantics-are-possible-heres-how-apache-kafka-does-it/">this post by the Kafka developers</a>
where they discuss how exactly-once semantics were added to Kafka a few years
ago. If you read it you'll see it's pretty much the same technique - client
retries with de-duplication of commands in the distributed log.</p>
<p>Finally, in <em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</em>, Martin Kleppman touches
upon this topic in several places; for example, in chapter 12 he discusses
exactly-once execution of operations and the engineering required to make it
possible.</p>

<div class="section" id="appendix-1-retries-with-put-and-linearizability">
<h2>Appendix 1: Retries with PUT and linearizability</h2>
<p>In this post we've added an APPEND operation to demonstrate the issues that
arise with retries and duplication. But APPEND differs significantly
from the original operations we've discussed in part 4: it's not idempotent.
Applying APPEND more than once creates an invalid value, which isn't true
for PUT - if we had retried PUT multiple times, the only outcome would be
writing the result twice.</p>
<p>While this seems logical on the surface, it turns out that even without operations
like APPEND, the system isn't linearizable if retries without de-duplication are
allowed. Here's a diagram (following the style of
<a class="reference external" href="../linearizability-in-distributed-systems/index.html">my post on linarizability</a>)
that demonstrates the issue:</p>
<img alt="Linearazibility diagram of PUTs with retries" class="align-center" src="../../images/2024/retry-put-not-linearizable.png" />
<p>This diagram describes a single &quot;register&quot;, let's assume the key &quot;foo&quot;. Let's
also assume that before any writes, the default value of all keys is 0. Here's
what happens:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Client A issues a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PUT('foo',1)</span></tt> request. The request gets committed by
the leader, which crashes before a reply is made to the client. The client
will continue periodically retrying.</li>
<li>In the meantime, a new leader is elected. Client C reads the value of the
register and gets a successful response (since the PUT of 1 was committed).</li>
<li>Client B uses the new leader to commit a new PUT, with value 2.</li>
<li>Client C reads the value of 2 from the register.</li>
<li>Client A's retry reaches the new leader, which commits another instance
of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PUT('foo',1)</span></tt>, overwriting
the value 2. Now when client C reads the register again, it gets 1 again.</li>
</ol>
<p>This sequence isn't linearizable; as far as the clients are concerned, since
operation (2) retrieved the value 1, it means (1) finished before (2); the
result of (4) also means that (3) happened after (1). This
makes (5) impossible in a linearizable system.</p>
<p>This is a known failure scenario in distributed systems; it's called <em>lost
update</em>. In our example, the <tt class="docutils literal">PUT(2)</tt> operation is essentially lost outside a
brief window just following it. The retry of <tt class="docutils literal">PUT(1)</tt> overwrites it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appendix-2-lost-updates-in-etcd-with-client-retries">
<h2>Appendix 2: lost updates in etcd with client retries</h2>
<p>To demonstrate that the issue discussed in this post isn't purely academic,
here's a real world example.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> is an industrial-strength key value DB based on
Raft. It's used extensively inside k8s and other projects. While the etcd
service itself is strict serializable, some of its client libraries turned
out to have the exact retry problem described in this post.</p>
<p>Here's a <a class="reference external" href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/jetcd-0.8.2">Jepsen analysis of jetcd</a>,
a Java-based client that automatically retries on failures. The analysis
concludes that this mechanism results in loss of linearizability, and recommends
to disable it. There's also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/14890">a lengthy discussion in a GitHub issue</a> with the
etcd developers about this. And <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/18424">another issue</a> has interesting
information as well.</p>
<p>The Jepsen analysis has a great quote which I want to repost here, because it's
so relevant to our discussion (and Appendix 1 in particular):</p>
<blockquote>
It is easy to assume that set(x, 5) is idempotent because applying it twice in
a row still produces the state x = 5. However, this operation is not longer
idempotent if its executions are interleaved with other writes—then, it leads to
lost update.</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, etcd doesn't support operations like APPEND at all. It can be
emulated with transactions, however, since etcd's <a class="reference external" href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/learning/api/#revisions">data store is versioned</a>.
These features also allow one to be more careful around failures when
non-linearizable behavior isn't acceptable. For example, we can perform writes
like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1. Read revision --&gt; $rev
2. TXN
      if mod_revision(k) == $rev
      PUT(k, v)
</pre></div>
<p>This will only assign <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">store(k)=v</span></tt> if there were no changes to the DB in the
meantime. The failure scenario shown in Appendix 1 cannot happen, because each
successful write increments the revision of the store.
If unsuccessful, this sequence of operations can be retried safely
(its only problem is with liveness, not safety).</p>
