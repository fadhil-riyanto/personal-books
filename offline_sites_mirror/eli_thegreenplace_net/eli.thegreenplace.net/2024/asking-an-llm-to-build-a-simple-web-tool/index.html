                <p>I've been really enjoying following <a class="reference external" href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison's blog posts</a> recently. Simon shows other
programmers the way LLMs will be used for code assistance in the future, and
posts full interactions with LLMs to build small tools or parts of larger
applications.</p>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/8/box-shadow-css-generator/">recent post</a>
caught my attention; here Simon got an LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet in this case) to
build a complete tool that lets one configure/tweak box shadow settings
and copy the resulting CSS code for use in a real application. One thing that
seemed interesting is that the LLM in this case used some heavyweight
dependencies (React + JSX) to implement this; Almost 3 MiB of dependency for
something that clearly needs only a few dozen lines of HTML + JS to implement;
yikes.</p>
<p>So I've decided to try my own experiment and get an LLM to do this without any
dependencies. It turned out to be very easy, because the LLM I used (in this
case ChatGPT 4o, but it could really have been any of the top-tier LLMs, I
think) opted for the no-dependency approach from the start. I was preparing to
ask it to adjust the code to remove dependencies, but this turned out to be
unnecessary.</p>
<p>The resulting tool is very similar to Simon's in functionality; it's deployed
at <a class="reference external" href="https://eliben.org/box-shadow-tool/">https://eliben.org/box-shadow-tool/</a>; here's a screenshot:</p>
<img alt="Screenshot of box shadow tool" class="align-center" src="../../images/2024/box-shadow-screenshot.png" />
<p>Here are my prompts:</p>
<blockquote>
CSS for a slight box shadow, build me a tool that helps me twiddle settings
and preview them and copy and paste out the CSS</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT produced a working tool but it didn't really look good on the page.</p>
<blockquote>
Yes, make the tool itself look a bit better with some CSS so it's all centered
on the screen and there's enough space for the preview box</blockquote>
<p>It still wasn't quite what I wanted.</p>
<blockquote>
the container has to be wider so all the text and sliders fix nicely, and
there's still not enough space for the shadows of the preview box to show
without overlapping with other elements</blockquote>
<p>Now it was looking better; I wanted a button to copy-paste, like in Simon's
demo:</p>
<blockquote>
this looks better; now add a nice-looking button at the bottom that copies the
resulting css code to the clipboard</blockquote>
<p>The code ChatGPT produced for the clipboard copy operation was flagged by
vscode as deprecated, so I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
it seems like &quot;document.execCommand('copy')&quot; is deprecated; is there a more
accepted way to do this?</blockquote>
<p>The final version can be seen in the <a class="reference external" href="https://eliben.org/box-shadow-tool/">online demo</a> (view-source). The complete ChatGPT
transcript is <a class="reference external" href="https://chatgpt.com/share/a05935cb-3e6d-4f5d-997f-5d8541450d1c">available here</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="insights">
<h2>Insights</h2>
<p>Overall, this was a positive experience. While a tool like this is very simple
to implement manually, doing it with an LLM was even quicker. The results are
still not perfect in terms of alignment and space, but they're good enough. At
this point one would probably just take over and do the final tweaks manually.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised by how stable the LLM managed to keep its output
throughout the interaction; it only modified the parts I asked it to, and the
rest of the code remained identical. Stability has been an issue with LLMs
(particularly for images), and I'm happy to see it holds well for code (there
could be some special tuning or prompt engineering for ChatGPT to make this work
well).</p>
