        <p>This book resembles the "Effective C++" series, in quite<br />
an intentional manner, it seems (the title, the numbered<br />
"items", the assertive titles of the items, etc). Therefore,<br />
it's quite difficult for me not to compare it to Scott Myers'<br />
books.
<p>
But this comparison makes me a little dissapointed, feeling<br />
that my hopes were not fulfilled. The "Effective C++" is a<br />
very advanced series of books, aiming mainly at expert C++<br />
programmers. Newbies have nothing to find in them - they won't<br />
understand the problems Myers is trying to solve, and they<br />
won't understand the solutions. The items are very in-depth<br />
and dive into the most complicated aspects of C++.</p>
<p>
So I was hoping for the same with "Effective Perl", but what<br />
I got was rather a beginner - early midlevel book. Some of the<br />
items in this book were covered in "Learning Perl" - the first<br />
and most basic Perl book of them all.</p>
<p>
This is probably<br />
a compliment to the Perl language - when two renown Perl gurus<br />
(Hall & Schwartz) try to write an "Effective C++" style book<br />
for Perl they just don't find topics complicated enough to<br />
explain. Truly, advanced C++ is much, much more complex than<br />
Perl (if you don't believe me, read "Modern C++ design").
</p>
<p>
"Effective Perl" is rather a very nice "intermediate level"<br />
book. It's good for newbies who've already read the basic material<br />
and coded some small Perl programs. The newbie programmer (one<br />
that's new to programming in general, not specifically Perl) will<br />
also enjoy an insight into the logical and modular stream of thought<br />
gurus use to analyze and design solutions to programming problems.<br />
In this domain it competes<br />
fairly with other mid-level "tips & techniques" Perl books like<br />
Perl Medic.</p>
<p>
The book is written in a light and entertaining style that is<br />
easy to understand. Examples are numerous and easy to follow.<br />
So, if you are a beginning Perl programmer yearning to inhale<br />
some "guru air", this is a good book for you. If you're a seasoned<br />
Perl hacker looking for advanced material to grind, look elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
P.S: It's nice to see some book finally including an overview<br />
of (s)printf flags - my usual source of information for this<br />
is the MSDN. But this appendix could be made more complete, I think.<br />
A more thorough synopsis of the various specifiers, with a few<br />
simple examples for demonstration would be great.</p>
