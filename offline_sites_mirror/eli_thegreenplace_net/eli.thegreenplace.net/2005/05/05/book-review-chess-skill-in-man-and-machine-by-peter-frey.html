Computer chess books are annoyingly rare. There's an abundancy
of chess books on the market, ranging from simple moves for
kids to full strategic treatises written by the best GMs and
chess analysts of the past. There are a lot of AI books that touch
the issue of chess, but *real* computer chess books are a precious
few.
</p><p>

This is peculiar. Chess is the fruit fly of AI (a beautiful analogy
borrowed from this book) - there can be no doubt about that. I would
expect more material on this topic, at least during the 80s and 90s
when chess-machine development still didn't reach a point of saturation.
</p><p>

Anywayz, to the review...
</p><p>

This is an old book, dated 1975 or so. When this book was written,
for example, there was still no Kasparov as a total world champ, no
Deep Blue, no Fritz/Junior/Shredder. In short, no programs that routinely
challenged the world champions. It shows in the author's opinion. For
example, he makes the utterly wrong prediction that "no computer expert
chess player will be developed until we gain an understanding of how the
human brain works". Palm-based chess players beat any beginner, desktop
programs like Junior beat most masters, and on slightly stronger machines
(not the Deep Blue monster, but a measly 4-way Xeon) they tie with world
champions. The discovery of how the brain works, and especially its application
to programming looks still very, very far away.
</p><p>

Being severely outdated, most of this book is good only from a historic
view-point really, but it does contain some interesting articles that
are relevant today. For instance, a basic analysis of human chess skill,
what makes us know how to filter moves, what makes some players better
than others, what makes GMs tick. There's also a quite understandable
treatment of computer chess basics that could be interesting for beginners.
</p><p>

The description of the best US chess program of that time - CHESS 4.5 (I say
US, because a Soviet KAISSA was comparable in strength) is also interesting,
though it leaves some brows raised if you're a programmer. The authors of
the program wrote it all in about 2-3 functions that closely intertwine - god
help the one who'd have to grok the code.
</p><p>

All in all, part of this book make an interesting read if you're a computer
chess enthusiast, but don't expect too much from it. I even can't recommend
another book, since I'm not aware of good modern books on this topic (maybe
it's time to write one ?)
