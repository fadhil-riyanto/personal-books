        <p>Having read (twice) and loved "Eugene Onegin" I decided to see what else Pushkin had to offer, so I purchased this 950 page collection.</p>
<p>The works of Pushkin, at least the ones reflected in this book, can be roughly divided to 3 categories: short poems (less than a page, or so), long poems - stories in verse, really (like "Onegin") and non-verse stories (prose).
<p>I came to a conclusion that his short poems are nice, but I get bored quickly reading them one after another. Perhaps it's fun to pick the favorites, read them a few times, learn them by heart, etc, but reading them in succession is not very entertaning.</p>
<p>The long poems - stories in verse, is what I liked the most. Apart from Eugene Onegin, which is included in this book and which I read (of course) the 3rd time, there are "The fountain of Bahchisaray", "The captive of Caucas", and others - most of them very good. It takes extraordinary skill to write a long story all in verse, and Pushkin just has this gift...</p>
<p>I didn't really like his prose. The writing is light, flowing and occasionally funny, but it's just not "it". He also writes about the lives of the Russian elite during the 17-19th centuries, but Tolstoy writes prose much better, IMHO. Besides, here comes the issue of reading many similar stories in succession. Most deal with pretty much the same things.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm glad I got this book. First of all I have my own copy of Onegin now. Second, there are a few other works I really liked and I'm glad to have. Pushkin is an excellent writer, especially of verse. I've got to sniff around and ask people what other great works of him I can put my hands on.</p>
