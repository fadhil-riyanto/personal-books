        How many times have you written this code in C++:<p>
<pre>
char line[BUF_LEN];
vector&lt;string&gt; file_lines;

while (fgets(line, BUF_LEN, filehandle))
{
   file_lines.push_back(line);
}
</pre>
<p>
My bet - a lot, if you're working with C++. I know I did (note the usage of fgets() - the C stdio library works much faster than C++'s fstream).
<p>
Well, let me tell you something: this code is flawed. "No way, I've used it zillions of times and it works like a dream" you think... sorry to dissapoint you.<p>
I'm now integrating the solution to a problem, and on my way I had to fight big, scary and hairy bug. A bug having to do with the code above.<p>
Now imagine you're not in the world of all-good, but in the world of hairy multi-process boundary cases.<p>
Your loop reads the last line of the file, which is not ended by '\n'. It's pushed into the vector. The loop comes back to read the next line - you'd expect it to stop, right ? Not always ! What if another process just wrote into the file, while you were pushing the line onto the vector. The other process added a couple of characters - so you read those and push'em to the vector. But that's wrong - in the file, it's all the same line (the last line wasn't terminated with '\n', recall) but you pushed it in parts, to two different vector locations !<p>
Yeah I know it's not something people usually think of, but it happens, and robust code must handle it. I had this problem in two places in my code, and each one needed a different solution, because of the way that line-reading loop was called and used:<p>
<ol>
<li>In one place, I don't care about the added characters, so I just check if the line contains a '\n' and if it doesn't, after pushing it in the vector, I break the loop.
<li>In another place, I do care about the added characters, so I have to keep a flag that specifies whether the last line was "partial" (no '\n'), and if it was I concatenate the contents to the last line, rather than pushing them into a separate location.
</ol>
