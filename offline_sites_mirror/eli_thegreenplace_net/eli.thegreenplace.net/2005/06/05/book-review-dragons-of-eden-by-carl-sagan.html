<p>When Sagan takes on himself the task to explain to the general public how our
brain works, the result is "Dragons of Eden" - an exciting tale of the
state-of-the-art in brain research, human psychology, mental diseases,
evolution, intelligence (both in humans and animals), dreams and speculations
about various uncovered issues, including extra-terrestrial intelligence.</p>

<p>
I have only good things to say about this book. It has the two qualities that
make a book a great reading - (1) fluid readability, (2) interesting content
that teaches me stuff I didn't know before. It has another trait - especially
important for me - it touches many topics that I have a great interest in, and
expands my views and knowledge on these topics - and for this I'm *very*
grateful to the author.</p>

<p>
Being very interested in evolution, I found the parts of the book that talk
about the evolution of the brain breath-taking. The meaning of the evolution of
extragenetic intelligence (brains in animals and humans) and extrasomatic
intelligence (books, computeres) in humans, the nature of instincts buried in
our "reptile brain" regions, the conflict between the left and right neocortex
and the purpose of each, this is exciting stuff !
</p>

<p>
As an utterly rational being, I always look for ways to prove to myself that
rationality is more important than emotionality. In one of the chapters of this
book, Sagan gives me a valuable clue - the emotional parts of our brain evolved
much earlier than the rational, and are common to most mammals. But what really
sets the human different from other animals is the evolution of the big
neocortex with the rational side of thought. The rational won the evolution was
against the emotional - homo sapiens rules this planet, after all.</p>

<p>
Will the next evolutionary step be a complete detachment of our mind from the
primate emotional instincts, and reliance only on the rational, more advanced
brain ? Funnily, this is very alike Artificial Intelligence. I just wonder what
arrives first...
</p>

<p>
Sagan did an extraordinary job with this book, and I certainly like his writing
a lot - I liked "Cosmos" but this book is even better. I'm impressed of how much
diverse, interesting and mind-opening information about so many topics is packet
in 250 small pages. Luckily I have another of his books on my shelf waiting in
the read-queue :-)
</p>

<p>
P.S. Carl Sagan was an astronomer, so evolution and brain-structure wasn't
exactly his main area of expertise (a fact he mentions in the book preface /
acknowledgements). And still, he wrote this book and got the Pulitzer prize for
it. Fully deserved, I'm awed at the quality and clarity of his writing. Reading
his books makes you want to be a scientist...</p>
