        <p>[read in Spanish]</p>
<p>It is surprising I haven't read this book before. Having very much enjoyed The Count of Monte Cristo I still dodged many recommendations on the Three Musketeers. Guess there just was always something else to read. Well, now thanks to my Spanish learning endeavors, I finally got to read it (I like reading books in their original tongue, and since this book is in French which I don't know, I figured it won't matter much which translation to read and the Spanish one was fine).</p>
<p>The Three Musketeers is a very vivacious and entertaining book. The plot circles around D'Artagnan, a young recruit in the king's guard forces, aspiring to become a "formal" Musketeer, his three Musketeer friends Athos, Porthos and Aramis, their squires and some of their enemies, most notably Milady de Winter.</p>
<p>The characters in this book are very well developed. The book is quite large (~900 pages) which gave the author ample space to build a unique personality to each one of the major characters. Milady is cruel and manipulative, Athos is cold and balanced - the reader starts to expect certain behavior from the persons depicted in the novel - a sign of a very deep acquaintance with them knitted carefully by the eclectic author. As a bonus, some interesting facts about the history of France are revealed.</p>
<p>As I said, The Three Musketeers is a big book, but one that flies quickly. The plot is captivating and flowing, encouraging to devour the book in a short time. Highly recommended.
