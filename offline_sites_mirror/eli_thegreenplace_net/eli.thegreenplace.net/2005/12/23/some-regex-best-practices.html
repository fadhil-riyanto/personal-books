        <p>I'm now going through "Perl best practices", and although I mostly like it, sometimes I meet passages I disagree with. For instance, the following, in section 12.2 Line Boundaries:</p>
<p>In addition to always using the /x flag, always use the /m flag. In every regular expression you ever write.</p>
<p>The normal behaviour of the ^ and $ metacharacters is unintuitive to most programmers, especially if they're coming from a Unix background. Almost all of the Unix utilities that feature regular expressions (e.g., sed, grep, awk) are intrinsically line-oriented. So in those utilities, ^ and $ naturally mean "match at the start of any line" and "match at the end of any line", respectively.</p>
<p>But they don't mean that in Perl.</p>
<p>In Perl, ^ and $ mean "match at the start of the entire string" and "match at the end of the entire string".</p>
<p>And then:</p>
<p>The /m mode makes ^ and $ work "naturally" (That is, it makes them work in the unnatural way in which most programmers think they work). Under /m, ^ no longer means "match at the start of the string"; it means "match at the start of any line". Likewise, $ no longer means "at end of string"; it means "at end of any line".</p>
<p>I can't disagree more ! Not all programmers come from a Unix background, especially now, 18 years into Perl's existence. I, for once, almost never used sed/awk. When I began programming on a Unix, Perl was already there and I quickly endorsed it as my swiss-knife tool instead of csh/awk/sed. Hence, for me ^ and $ matching at the beginning and end of string is the most natural thing possible. Why shouldn't I use a popular Perl regex syntax, only because some Unix old-timers confuse it with something which it's not ?</p>
<p>In the next section, the author goes on to suggest:</p>
<p>Even if you don't adopt the previous practice of always using /m, using ^ and $ with their default meanings is a bad idea. Sure, you know what ^ and $ actually mean in a Perl regex. But will those who read or maintain your code know? Or is it more likely that they will misinterpret those metacharacters in the ways described earlier?</p>
<p>As is commonly discussed on Perlmonks, people not knowing the language well enough are not a reason not to use Perl's advanced features !</p>
<p>Perl provides markers that alwaysand unambiguouslymean "start of string" and "end of string": \A and \z (capital A, but lowercase z). They mean "start/end of string" regardless of whether /m is active. They mean "start/end of string" regardless of what the reader thinks ^ and $ mean.</p>
<p>I may be a n00b, but I've never used \A and \z and only vaguely remember what they do. OTOH, I know perfectly well what ^ and $ are. I think that most programmers are like this...</p>
<p>The vast majority of the advices given in this book are very good, though.
