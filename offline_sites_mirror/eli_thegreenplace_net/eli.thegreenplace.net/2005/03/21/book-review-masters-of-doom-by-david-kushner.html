<p>
If you have read and immenselty enjoyed Levy's "Hackers",
like I did, and were looking for something to take on
from where it ended (mid 80s) - "Masters of Doom" is the book.
</p><p>

There's something very special and captivating in the writing
style of Hackers, which I couldn't find in any other place since
reading it, until now. Apart from a very profound research on
the gaming world, I bet that David Kushner read Hackers and
specifically tried to gather what is so special about its style.
He succeeded - reading Masters of Doom is the same enchanting,
unputdownable feeling as with Hackers. If you are a hacker (in
the good sense, of course) yourself, this book "speaks" to you.
</p><p>

The book traces the history of id software, the small company
that created Commander Keen (remember that ?) Doom (1, 2 and recently
3) and Quake (1, 2 and 3 Arena). Its first half is mostly about
passion of programming and of computer games - amazing how such
a small team, basing on one really talented programmer (John Carmack)
can build huge and complex applications like Doom.
</p><p>

id Software is a proof that you don't need a 100-men team and a budget
in the 7 digits to suceed. A small bunch of friends can create great
and popular software hacking away at the living room of their home.
It is very, very inspiring for all of us code-lovers. The company's
key programmer is a portrait of everything I like about computer
programming. When he has to solve a new problem, he eagerly buys several
books on the subject and avidly reads them, hacking small simulations
to help him understand the theory along the way.
</p><p>

The second part of the book was mostly about the gaming industry. Less
of pure hacker-delight, but still very interesting and told in a vivid
and captivating language. Being a junkie of computer games helps, especially
of first person shooters (I myself am an avid Unreal redeemer-worshipper).
</p><p>

All in all an excellent book I really enjoyed. At last, a worthy heir
of Hackers - now I just wish someone writes such about about some other
programming area - Masters of Doom certainly has the game development covered.
