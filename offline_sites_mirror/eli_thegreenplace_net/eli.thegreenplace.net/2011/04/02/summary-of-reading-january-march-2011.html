        <ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot; by Haruki Murakami - I've enjoyed previous books I read by Murakami, <em>despite</em> their mysticism. This one, however, was a bit too much. Although it started nicely enough, with Murakami's amazing writing style pulling you completely into the world he depicts, it became weirder and weirder and almost grotesque towards its end. Not to say that I didn't like it at all, I did, but less than his other books.</li>
<li>&quot;Why do babies cry?&quot; by Sivan Ofiri and Irit Shaked (read in Hebrew) - This book is full of strange conflicts. On one hand it tries to preach a scientific approach - teaching the reader to take into account the tribal hunter-gatherer origin of homo sapiens when approaching the way babies should be handled. On the other hand it's full of ridiculous, unexplained homeopathic and naturopathic tips. It looks like someone edited the book and sprinkled &quot;Bach flowers / Rescue Remedy can help&quot; all around it. Even ignoring these parts, the book is of mixed quality. While tedious at times, it does contain some advice that sounds useful here and there.</li>
<li>&quot;The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind&quot; by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer - An inspiring story of a science-savvy kid in poverty-stricken Malawi building a windmill to generate electricity for his family's home, using junk from the scrapyard and a bicycle dynamo. Well written and fun to read.</li>
<li>&quot;Writing Places&quot; by William Zinsser - A condensed autobiography, focused on the different places in which he did his writing. As you would expect from Zinsser, it's extremely well-written. No matter what he writes about, it makes a good reading.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot; by Carl Sagan</li>
